Its effectiveness for word sense disambiguation (WSD) is also investigated. One of the key challenges for computer processing of highly inflected languages is to deal with the frequent morphological variations of the root words appearing in the text. Therefore, a lemmatizer is essential for developing natural language processing (NLP) tools for such languages. In this experiment, Bengali, which is the national language of Bangladesh and the second most popular language in the Indian subcontinent, has been taken as a reference. In order to design the Bengali lemmatizer (named as BenLem), possible transformations through which surface words are formed from lemmas are studied so that appropriate reverse transformations can be applied on a surface word to get the corresponding lemma back. BenLem is found to be capable of handling both inflectional and derivational morphology in Bengali. It is evaluated on a set of 18 news articles taken from the FIRE Bengali News Corpus consisting of 3,342 surface words (excluding proper nouns) and found to be 81.95&percnt; accurate. The role of the lemmatizer is then investigated for Bengali WSD. Ten highly polysemous Bengali words are considered for sense disambiguation. The FIRE corpus and a collection of Tagoreâ\u20AC™s short stories are considered for creating the WSD dataset. Different WSD systems are considered for this experiment, and it is noticed that BenLem improves the performance of all the WSD systems and the improvements are statistically significant."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3105","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3105","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22095","fieldValue":" We study protocols for strong authentication and key exchange in asymmetric scenarios where the authentication server possesses ~a pair of private and public keys while the client has only a weak human-memorizable password as its authentication key. We present and analyze several simple password authentication protocols in this scenario, and show that the security of these protocols can be formally proven based on standard cryptographic assumptions. Remarkably, our analysis shows optimal resistance to off-line password guessing attacks under the choice of suitable public key encryption functions. In addition to user authentication, we describe ways to enhance these protocols to provide two-way authentication, authenticated key exchange, defense against server's compromise, and user anonymity. We complement these results with a proof that strongly indicates that public key techniques are unavoidable for password protocols that resist off-line guessing attacks. As a further contribution, we introduce the notion of public passwords that enables the use of the above protocols in situations where the client's machine does not have the means to validate the server's public key. Public passwords serve as \"hand-held certificates\" that the user can carry without the need for specal computing devices."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22095","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22095","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22096","fieldValue":" A router-based packet-filtering firewall is an effective way of protecting an enterprise network from unauthorized access. However, it will not work efficiently in an ATM network because it requires the termination of end-to-end ATM connections at a packet-filtering router, which incurs huge overhead of SAR (Segmentation and Reassembly). Very few approaches to this problem have been proposed in the literature, and none is completely satisfactory. In this paper we present the hardware design of a high-speed ATM firewall that does not require the termination of an end-to-end connection in the middle. We propose a novel firewall design philosophy, called Quality of Firewalling (QoF), that applies security measures of different strength to traffic with different risk levels and show how it can be implemented in our firewall. Compared with the traditional firewalls, this ATM firewall performs exactly the same packet-level filtering without compromising the performance and has the same \"look and feel\" by sitting at the chokepoint between the trusted ATM LAN and untrusted ATM WAN. It is also easy to manage and flexible to use."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22096","fieldValue":"TCP\/IP"}
