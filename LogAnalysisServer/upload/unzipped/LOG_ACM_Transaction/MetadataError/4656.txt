It spans the full spectrum of operational, clinical, and financial perspectives, over varying horizons: operationalâ\u20AC\u201Da few hours or days ahead; tacticalâ\u20AC\u201Dweeks or a few months ahead; and strategic, which involves planning on monthly and yearly scales. Simulation offers a natural framework within which to address these challenges, as realistic ED models are typically intractable analytically. We apply a general and flexible ED simulator to address several significant problems that arose in a large Israeli hospital. The article focuses mainly, but not exclusively, on workforce staffing problems over these time horizons. First, we demonstrate that our simulation model can support real-time control, which enables short-term prediction and operational planning (physician and nurse staffing) for several hours or days ahead. To this end, we present a novel simulation-based technique that implements the concept of offered-load and discover that it performs better than a common alternative. Then we evaluate ED staff scheduling that adjusts for midterm changes (tactical horizon, several weeks or months ahead). Finally, we analyze the design and staffing problems that arose from physical relocation of the ED (strategic yearly horizon). Application of the simulation-based approach led to the implementation of our design and staffing recommendations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25035","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25035","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25036","fieldValue":"McClean, Sally"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25036","fieldValue":" Stroke disease places a heavy burden on society, incurring long periods of hospital and community care. Also stroke is a highly complex disease with heterogeneous outcomes and multiple strategies for therapy and care. In this article we develop a modeling framework that clusters patients with respect to their length of stay (LOS); phase-type models are then used to describe patient flows for each cluster. In most cases, there are multiple outcomes, such as discharge to normal residence, nursing home, or death. We therefore derive a novel analytical model for the distribution of LOS in such situations. A model of the whole care system is developed, based on Poisson admissions to hospital, and results obtained for expected numbers in different states of the system at any time. We can thus describe the whole integrated system of stroke patient care, which will facilitate planning of services. We also use the basic model to build a discrete-event simulation, which incorporates back-up queues to model delayed discharge. Based on stroke patients' data from the Belfast City Hospital, various scenarios are explored with a focus on the potential efficiency gains if LOS, prior to discharge to a private nursing home, can be reduced. Predictions for bed occupancy are also provided. The overall modeling framework characterizes the behavior of stroke patient populations, with a focus on integrated system-wide planning, encompassing hospital and community services. Within this general framework we can develop either analytic or simulation models that take account of patient heterogeneity and multiple care options."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25036","fieldValue":"LOS"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25036","fieldValue":"A modeling framework that combines markov models and discrete-event simulation for stroke patient care"}
