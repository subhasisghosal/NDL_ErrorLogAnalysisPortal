{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24488","fieldValue":" Socio-Technical Systems demand an evolution of computing into social computing, with a transition from an individualistic to a societal view. As such, they seem particularly suitable to realize multiparty, cross-organizational systems. Multi-Agent Systems are a natural candidate to realize Socio-Technical Systems. However, while Socio-Technical Systems envisage an explicit layer that contains the regulations that all parties must respect in their interaction, and thus preserve the agents' autonomy, current frameworks and platforms require to hard-code the coordination requirements inside the agents. We propose to explicitly represent the missing layer of Socio-Technical Systems in terms of social relationships among the involved parties, that is, in terms of a set of normatively defined relationships among two or more parties, subject to social control by monitoring the observable behaviour. In our proposal, social relationships are resources, available to agents, who use them in their practical reasoning. Both agents and social relationships are first-class entities of the model. The work also describes 2COMM4JADE, a framework that realizes the proposal by extending the well-known JADE and CArtAgO. The impact of the approach on programming is explained both conceptually and with the help of an example."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24488","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24488","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24489","fieldValue":" Understanding the factors that impact the popularity dynamics of social media can drive the design of effective information services, besides providing valuable insights to content generators and online advertisers. Taking YouTube as case study, we analyze how video popularity evolves since upload, extracting popularity trends that characterize groups of videos. We also analyze the referrers that lead users to videos, correlating them, features of the video and early popularity measures with the popularity trend and total observed popularity the video will experience. Our findings provide fundamental knowledge about popularity dynamics and its implications for services such as advertising and search."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24489","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24489","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24490","fieldValue":"Tifrea-Marciuska, Oana"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24490","fieldValue":" The Web has recently been evolving into a system that is in many ways centered on social interactions and is now more and more becoming what is called the Social Semantic Web. One of the many implications of such an evolution is that the ranking of search results no longer depends solely on the structure of the interconnections among Web pagesâ\u20AC\u201Dinstead, the social components must also come into play. In this article, we argue that such rankings can be based on ontological background knowledge and on user preferences. Another aspect that has become increasingly important in recent times is that of uncertainty management, since uncertainty can arise due to many uncontrollable factors. To combine these two aspects, we propose extensions of the Datalog&plus;\/-- family of ontology languages that both allow for the management of partially ordered preferences of groups of users as well as uncertainty, which is represented via a probabilistic model. We focus on answering k-rank queries in this context, presenting different strategies to compute group preferences as an aggregation of the preferences of a collection of single users. We also study merging operators that are useful for combining the preferences of the users with those induced by the values obtained from the probabilistic model. We then provide algorithms to answer k-rank queries for DAQs (disjunctions of atomic queries) under these group preferences and uncertainty that generalizes top-k queries based on the iterative computation of classical skyline answers. We show that such DAQ answering in Datalog&plus;\/-- can be done in polynomial time in the data complexity, under certain reasonable conditions, as long as query answering can also be done in polynomial time (in the data complexity) in the underlying classical ontology. Finally, we present a prototype implementation of the query answering system, as well as experimental results (on the running time of our algorithms and the quality of their results) obtained from real-world ontological data and preference models, derived from information gathered from real users, showing in particular that our approach is feasible in practice."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24490","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24490","fieldValue":"ACM"}
