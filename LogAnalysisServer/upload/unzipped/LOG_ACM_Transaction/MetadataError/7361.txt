{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9532","fieldValue":" WDM optical networks provide unprecedented high speed and reliability for message transfer among the nodes. All-to-all routing is a fundamental routing problem in such networks and has been well studied on single hop WDM networks. However, the number of wavelengths to realize all-to-all routing on the single hop model typically is very large. One way to reduce the number of wavelengths is to use k-hop routing, in which each routing path consists of k segments and each segment is assigned a different wavelength, where k usually is a small constant. Because of the complexity of design and analysis for such a routing problem, only few papers discussed and proposed all-to-all routing by k â\u2030¥ 2 hops. However, the proposed algorithms are usually exceeding complicated even for ring topologies. Often, an ad hoc approach is employed to deal with each individual topology.In this paper we propose a generic method for all-to-all routing in multi-hop WDM networks, which aims to minimize the number of wavelengths. We illustrate the approach for several optical networks of commonly used topology, including lines, rings, tori, meshes, and complete binary trees. For each case an upper bound on the number of wavelengths is obtained. The results show that this approach produces clear routing paths, requires less wavelengths, and can easily incorporate load balancing. For simple topologies such as lines and rings, this approach easily produces the same bounds on the number of wavelengths that were hard-obtained previously. Moreover, this general approach provides a unified routing algorithm for any d-dimensional torus, which seems impossible to obtain by the previous approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9532","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9532","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9532","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8371","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/9533","fieldValue":"Le Boudec, Jean-Yves"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9533","fieldValue":" We define \"random trip\", a generic mobility model for random, independent node motions, which contains as special cases: the random waypoint on convex or nonconvex domains, random walk on torus, billiards, city section, space graph, intercity and other models. We show that, for this model, a necessary and sufficient condition for a time-stationary regime to exist is that the mean trip duration (sampled at trip endpoints) is finite. When this holds, we show that the distribution of node mobility state converges to the time-stationary distribution, starting from the origin of an arbitrary trip. For the special case of random waypoint, we provide for the first time a proof and a sufficient and necessary condition of the existence of a stationary regime, thus closing a long standing issue. We show that random walk on torus and billiards belong to the random trip class of models, and establish that the time-limit distribution of node location for these two models is uniform, for any initial distribution, even in cases where the speed vector does not have circular symmetry. Using Palm calculus, we establish properties of the time-stationary regime, when the condition for its existence holds. We provide an algorithm to sample the simulation state from a time-stationary distribution at time 0 (\"perfect simulation\"), without computing geometric constants. For random waypoint on the sphere, random walk on torus and billiards, we show that, in the time-stationary regime, the node location is uniform.
