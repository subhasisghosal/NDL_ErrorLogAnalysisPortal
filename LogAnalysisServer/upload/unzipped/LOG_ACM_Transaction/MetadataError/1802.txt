DINUS allows arbitrary knot intervals on the edges, allows incorporation of special features, and provides limit point as well as limit normal rules. It is the first subdivision scheme that gives the user all this flexibility and at the same time all essential limit information, which is important for applications in modeling and adaptive rendering. DINUS is also amenable to analysis techniques for stationary schemes. We implemented DINUS as an Autodesk Maya plugin to show several modeling and rendering examples."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16342","fieldValue":"NURBS"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16342","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16342","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16343","fieldValue":" The incorporation of randomness is critical for the believability and effectiveness of controllers for characters in competitive games. We present a fully automatic method for generating intelligent real-time controllers for characters in such a game. Our approach uses game theory to deal with the ramifications of the characters acting simultaneously, and generates controllers which employ both long-term planning and an intelligent use of randomness. Our results exhibit nuanced strategies based on unpredictability, such as feints and misdirection moves, which take into account and exploit the possible strategies of an adversary. The controllers are generated by examining the interaction between the rules of the game and the motions generated from a parametric motion graph. This involves solving a large-scale planning problem, so we also describe a new technique for scaling this process to higher dimensions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16343","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16343","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16344","fieldValue":" Measuring distances between pairs of points on a 3D surface is a fundamental problem in computer graphics and geometric processing. For most applications, the important properties of a distance are that it is a metric, smooth, locally isotropic, globally â\u20ACœshape-aware,â\u20AC? isometry-invariant, insensitive to noise and small topology changes, parameter-free, and practical to compute on a discrete mesh. However, the basic methods currently popular in computer graphics (e.g., geodesic and diffusion distances) do not have these basic properties. In this article, we propose a new distance measure based on the biharmonic differential operator that has all the desired properties. This new surface distance is related to the diffusion and commute-time distances, but applies different (inverse squared) weighting to the eigenvalues of the Laplace-Beltrami operator, which provides a nice trade-off between nearly geodesic distances for small distances and global shape-awareness for large distances. The article provides theoretical and empirical analysis for a large number of meshes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16344","fieldValue":"ACM"}
