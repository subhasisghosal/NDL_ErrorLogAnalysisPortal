The main features of the algorithm are retrieval effectiveness, generality, and computational efficiency. We test our approach on seven languages (using collections from the TREC, CLEF, and FIRE evaluation platforms) of varying morphological complexity. Significant performance improvement over plain word-based retrieval, three other language-independent morphological normalizers, as well as rule-based stemmers is demonstrated."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24038","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24038","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24039","fieldValue":"Garcia-Molina, Hector"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24039","fieldValue":" We study the problem of making recommendations when the objects to be recommended must also satisfy constraints or requirements. In particular, we focus on course recommendations: the courses taken by a student must satisfy requirements (e.g., take two out of a set of five math courses) in order for the student to graduate. Our work is done in the context of the CourseRank system, used by students to plan their academic program at Stanford University. Our goal is to recommend to these students courses that not only help satisfy constraints, but that are also desirable (e.g., popular or taken by similar students). We develop increasingly expressive models for course requirements, and present a variety of schemes for both checking if the requirements are satisfied, and for making recommendations that take into account the requirements. We show that some types of requirements are inherently expensive to check, and we present exact, as well as heuristic techniques, for those cases. Although our work is specific to course requirements, it provides insights into the design of recommendation systems in the presence of complex constraints found in other applications."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24039","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24039","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24040","fieldValue":" The unprecedented and ever-growing number of Web videos nowadays leads to the massive existence of near-duplicate videos. Very often, some near-duplicate videos exhibit great content changes, while the user perceives little information change, for example, color features change significantly when transforming a color video with a blue filter. These feature changes contribute to low-level video similarity computations, making conventional similarity-based near-duplicate video retrieval techniques incapable of accurately capturing the implicit relationship between two near-duplicate videos with fairly large content modifications. In this paper, we introduce a new dimension for near-duplicate video retrieval. Different from existing near-duplicate video retrieval approaches which are based on video-content similarity, we explore the correlation between two videos. The intuition is that near-duplicate videos should preserve strong information correlation in spite of intensive content changes. More effective retrieval with stronger tolerance is achieved by replacing video-content similarity measures with information correlation analysis. Theoretical justification and experimental results prove the effectiveness of correlation-based near-duplicate retrieval."}
