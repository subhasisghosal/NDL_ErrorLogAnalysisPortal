A user query is compared with all the representatives of the clusters, and on the basis of such comparisons, those clusters having many close neighbors with respect to the query are selected for searching. This paper presents an estimation of the number of close neighbors in a cluster in relation to the given query. The estimation takes into consideration the dependencies between terms. It is demonstrated by experiments that the estimate is accurate and the time to generate the estimate is small."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13932","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13932","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13933","fieldValue":" A unifying model for the study of database performance is proposed.

This paper studies the problem of database backup and recovery for such systems, and presents an analytic model of their operation. Five key design decisions are identified and an optimization procedure for each is developed. A design algorithm that quickly provides parameters for a near-optimal differential file architecture is provided."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13934","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13934","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13935","fieldValue":"Larson, Per-ke"}
