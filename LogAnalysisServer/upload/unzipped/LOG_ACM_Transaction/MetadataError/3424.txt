{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21231","fieldValue":" In wireless sensor networks, multiple flows from data collecting sensors to an aggregating sink could traverse paths that are largely interference coupled. These interference effects manifest themselves as congestion, and cause the flows to experience high packet loss and arbitrary packet delays. This is particularly problematic in event-based sensor networks (such as those in disaster recovery missions) where some flows are of greater importance than others and require a higher fidelity in terms of packet delivery and timeliness. In this paper we present COMUT (COngestion control for MUlti-class Traffic), a distributed cluster-based mechanism for supporting multiple classes of traffic in sensor networks. COMUT is based on the self-organization of the network into clusters, each of which autonomously and proactively monitors congestion within its localized scope. The clusters then exchange appropriate information to facilitate system wide rate control where, each data source, depending on the relative importance of its data flow and the experienced congestion en route the sink, is coerced into controlling its rate. Our simulation results demonstrate that (i) our techniques are highly effective in dealing with multiple, interfering flows and in achieving high delivery ratios and low delays compared to traditional approaches, (ii) operate successfully over multiple underlying routing protocols, (iii) provide higher throughput to higher importance flows, (iv) are responsive to failures and, finally, (v) achieve substantial energy savings due to the considerable reduction in packet drops via the effective regulation of the network load."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21231","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21231","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21232","fieldValue":" Networking protocols for multihop wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are required to simultaneously minimize resource usage as well as optimize performance metrics such as latency and reliability. This article explores the energy-latency-reliability tradeoff for broadcast in WSNs by presenting a new protocol called PBBF. Essentially, for a given reliability level, energy and latency are found to be inversely related and our study quantifies this relationship at the reliability boundary. Therefore, PBBF offers an application designer considerable flexibility in the choice of desired operation points. Furthermore, we propose an extension to dynamically adjust the PBBF parameters to minimize the input required from the designer."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21232","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21232","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21233","fieldValue":" Previous approaches for computing duplicate-sensitive aggregates in wireless sensor networks have used a tree topology, in order to conserve energy and to avoid double-counting sensor readings. However, a tree topology is not robust against node and communication failures, which are common in sensor networks. In this article, we present synopsis diffusion, a general framework for achieving significantly more accurate and reliable answers by combining energy-efficient multipath routing schemes with techniques that avoid double-counting. Synopsis diffusion avoids double-counting through the use of order- and duplicate-insensitive (ODI) synopses that compactly summarize intermediate results during in-network aggregation. We provide a surprisingly simple test that makes it easy to check the correctness of an ODI synopsis. We show that the properties of ODI synopses and synopsis diffusion create implicit acknowledgments of packet delivery. Such acknowledgments enable energy-efficient adaptation of message routes to dynamic message loss conditions, even in the presence of asymmetric links. Finally, we illustrate using extensive simulations the significant robustness, accuracy, and energy-efficiency improvements of synopsis diffusion over previous approaches."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21233","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21233","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21234","fieldValue":" Sensor networks have a significant potential in diverse applications some of which are already beginning to be deployed in areas such as environmental monitoring. As the application logic becomes more complex, programming difficulties are becoming a barrier to adoption of these networks. The difficulty in programming sensor networks is not only due to their inherently distributed nature but also the need for mechanisms to address their harsh operating conditions such as unreliable communications, faulty nodes, and extremely constrained resources. Researchers have proposed different programming models to overcome these difficulties with the ultimate goal of making programming easy while making full use of available resources. In this article, we first explore the requirements for programming models for sensor networks. Then we present a taxonomy of the programming models, classified according to the level of abstractions they provide. We present an evaluation of various programming models for their responsiveness to the requirements. Our results point to promising efforts in the area and a discussion of the future directions of research in this area."}
