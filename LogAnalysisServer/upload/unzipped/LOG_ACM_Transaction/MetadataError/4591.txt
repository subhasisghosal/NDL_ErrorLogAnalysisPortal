Particularly, we study variable-sample techniques, in which the objective function is replaced, at each iteration, by a sample average approximation. We first provide general results on the schedule of sample sizes, under which variable-sample methods yield consistent estimators as well as bounds on the estimation error. Because the convergence analysis is performed pathwisely, we are able to obtain our results in a flexible setting, which requires mild assumptions on the distributions and which includes the possibility of using different sampling distributions along the algorithm. We illustrate these ideas by studying a modification of the well-known pure random search method, adapting it to the variable-sample scheme, and show conditions for convergence of the algorithm. Implementation issues are discussed and numerical results are presented to illustrate the ideas."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24869","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24869","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24870","fieldValue":" An important use for discrete-event simulation models lies in comparing and contrasting competing design alternatives without incurring any physical costs. This article presents a survey of the literature for two widely used classes of statistical methods for selecting the best design from among a finite set of k alternatives: ranking and selection (R&S) and multiple comparison procedures (MCPs). A comprehensive survey of each topic is presented along with a summary of recent unified R&S-MCP approaches. Procedures are recommended based on their statistical efficiency and ease of application; guidelines for procedure application are offered."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24870","fieldValue":"Discrete-event simulation optimization using ranking, selection, and multiple comparison procedures: A survey"}
