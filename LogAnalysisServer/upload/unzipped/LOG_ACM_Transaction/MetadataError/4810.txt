When searching objects or scenes in the 3D world, which viewing angle is more likely to be successful&quest; More particularly, if the first query fails to find the right target, how should the user control the mobile camera to form the second query&quest; In this article, we propose a novel Active Query Sensing system for mobile location search, which actively suggests the best subsequent query view to recognize the physical location in the mobile environment. The proposed system includes two unique components: (1) an offline process for analyzing the saliencies of different views associated with each geographical location, which predicts the location search precisions of individual views by modeling their self-retrieval score distributions. (2) an online process for estimating the view of an unseen query, and suggesting the best subsequent view change. Specifically, the optimal viewing angle change for the next query can be formulated as an online information theoretic approach. Using a scalable visual search system implemented over a NYC street view dataset (0.3 million images), we show a performance gain by reducing the failure rate of mobile location search to only 12&percnt; after the second query. We have also implemented an end-to-end functional system, including user interfaces on iPhones, client-server communication, and a remote search server. This work may open up an exciting new direction for developing interactive mobile media applications through the innovative exploitation of active sensing and query formulation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25466","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25466","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25467","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25467","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25468","fieldValue":" With advance in mobile 3D display, mobile 3D video is already enabled by the wireless multimedia networking, and it will be gradually popular since it can make people enjoy the natural 3D experience anywhere and anytime. In current stage, mobile 3D video is generally delivered over the heterogeneous network combined by wired and wireless channels. How to guarantee the optimal 3D visual quality of experience (QoE) for the mobile 3D video streaming is one of the important topics concerned by the service provider. In this article, we propose a QoE-oriented transcoding approach to enhance the quality of mobile 3D video service. By learning the pre-controlled QoE patterns of 3D contents, the proposed 3D visual QoE inferring model can be utilized to regulate the transcoding configurations in real-time according to the feedbacks of network and user-end device information. In the learning stage, we propose a piecewise linear mean opinion score (MOS) interpolation method to further reduce the cumbersome manual work of preparing QoE patterns. Experimental results show that the proposed transcoding approach can provide the adapted 3D stream to the heterogeneous network, and further provide superior QoE performance to the fixed quantization parameter (QP) transcoding and mean squared error (MSE) optimized transcoding for mobile 3D video streaming."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25468","fieldValue":"ACM"}
