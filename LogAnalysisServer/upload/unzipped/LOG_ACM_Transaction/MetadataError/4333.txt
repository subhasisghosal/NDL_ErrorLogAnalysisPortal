Therefore, combining relations is the key to effective information extraction (IE) on free text datasets with a small set of training samples. Previous approaches to bootstrapping for IE used different types of relations, such as dependency or co-occurrence, and faced the problems of paraphrasing and misalignment of instances. To cope with these problems, we propose a framework that integrates several types of relations. After extracting candidate entities, our framework evaluates relations between them at the phrasal, dependency, semantic frame, and discourse levels. For each of these levels, we build a classifier that outputs a score for relation instances. In order to integrate these scores, we propose three strategies: (1) integrate evaluation scores from each relation classifier; (2) incorporate the elimination of negatively labeled instances in a previous strategy; and (3) add cascading of extracted relations into strategy (2). Our framework improves the state-of-art results for supervised systems by 8&percnt;, 15&percnt;, 3&percnt;, and 5&percnt; on MUC4 (terrorism); MUC6 (management succession); ACE RDC 2003 (news, general types); and ACE RDC 2003 (news, specific types) domains respectively."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24011","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24011","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24012","fieldValue":"Lim, Ee-Peng"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24012","fieldValue":"Tan, Teck-Tim"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24012","fieldValue":" Spatio-temporal data concerning the movement of individuals over space and time contains latent information on the associations among these individuals. Sources of spatio-temporal data include usage logs of mobile and Internet technologies. This article defines a spatio-temporal event by the co-occurrences among individuals that indicate potential associations among them. Each spatio-temporal event is assigned a weight based on the precision and uniqueness of the event. By aggregating the weights of events relating two individuals, we can determine the strength of association between them. We conduct extensive experimentation to investigate both the efficacy of the proposed model as well as the computational complexity of the proposed algorithms. Experimental results on three real-life spatio-temporal datasets cross-validate each other, lending greater confidence on the reliability of our proposed model."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24012","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24012","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24013","fieldValue":" This article presents two probabilistic models for answering ranking in the multilingual question-answering (QA) task, which finds exact answers to a natural language question written in different languages. Although some probabilistic methods have been utilized in traditional monolingual answer-ranking, limited prior research has been conducted for answer-ranking in multilingual question-answering with formal methods. This article first describes a probabilistic model that predicts the probabilities of correctness for individual answers in an independent way. It then proposes a novel probabilistic method to jointly predict the correctness of answers by considering both the correctness of individual answers as well as their correlations. As far as we know, this is the first probabilistic framework that proposes to model the correctness and correlation of answer candidates in multilingual question-answering and provide a novel approach to design a flexible and extensible system architecture for answer selection in multilingual QA. An extensive set of experiments were conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed probabilistic methods in English-to-Chinese and English-to-Japanese cross-lingual QA, as well as English, Chinese, and Japanese monolingual QA using TREC and NTCIR questions."}
