A scientist must first formulate a hypothesis based on what he or she sees and then devise a variety of experiments to test it. Given the rapid growth of data, it has become virtually impossible for a person to manually inspect all data to find all of the interesting hypotheses for testing. In this article, we propose and develop a data-driven framework for automatic hypothesis testing and analysis. We define a hypothesis as a comparison between two or more subpopulations. We find subpopulations for comparison using frequent pattern mining techniques and then pair them up for statistical hypothesis testing. We also generate additional information for further analysis of the hypotheses that are deemed significant. The number of hypotheses generated can be very large, and many of them are very similar. We develop algorithms to remove redundant hypotheses and present a succinct set of significant hypotheses to users. We conducted a set of experiments to show the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. The results show that our system can help users (1) identify significant hypotheses efficiently, (2) isolate the reasons behind significant hypotheses efficiently, and (3) find confounding factors that form Simpsonâ\u20AC™s paradoxes with discovered significant hypotheses."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8015","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8015","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8016","fieldValue":" Process discovery has emerged as a powerful approach to support the analysis and the design of complex processes. It consists of analyzing a set of traces registering the sequence of tasks performed along several enactments of a transactional system, in order to build a process model that can explain all the episodes recorded over them. An approach to accomplish this task is presented that can benefit from the background knowledge that, in many cases, is available to the analysts taking care of the process (re-)design. The approach is based on encoding the information gathered from the log and the (possibly) given background knowledge in terms of precedence constraints, that is, of constraints over the topology of the resulting process models. Mining algorithms are eventually formulated in terms of reasoning problems over precedence constraints, and the computational complexity of such problems is thoroughly analyzed by tracing their tractability frontier. Solution algorithms are proposed and their properties analyzed. These algorithms have been implemented in a prototype system, and results of a thorough experimental activity are discussed."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8016","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8016","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/8017","fieldValue":"Ling, Charles X"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8017","fieldValue":" Making accurate recommendations for cold-start users is a challenging yet important problem in recommendation systems. Including more information from other domains is a natural solution to improve the recommendations. However, most previous work in cross-domain recommendations has focused on improving prediction accuracy with several severe limitations. In this article, we extend our previous work on clustering-based matrix factorization in single domains into cross domains. In addition, we utilize recent results on unobserved ratings. Our new method can more effectively utilize data from auxiliary domains to achieve better recommendations, especially for cold-start users. For example, our method improves the recall to 21&percnt; on average for cold-start users, whereas previous methods result in only 15&percnt; recall in the cross-domain Amazon dataset. We also observe almost the same improvements in the Epinions dataset. Considering that it is often difficult to make even a small improvement in recommendations, for cold- start users in particular, our result is quite significant."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8017","fieldValue":"ACM"}
