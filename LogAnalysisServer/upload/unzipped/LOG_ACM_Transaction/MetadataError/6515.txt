A set of descriptive tags has to be manually entered by users whenever they post a resource. This process can be simplified by the use of tag recommendation systems. Their objective is to suggest potentially useful tags to the user. We present a hybrid tag recommendation system together with a scalable, highly efficient system architecture. The system is able to utilize user feedback to tune its parameters to specific characteristics of the underlying tagging system and adapt the recommendation models to newly added content. The evaluation of the system on six real-life datasets demonstrated the systemâ\u20AC™s ability to combine tags from various sources (e.g., resource content or tags previously used by the user) to achieve the best quality of recommended tags. It also confirmed the importance of parameter tuning and content adaptation. A series of additional experiments allowed us to better understand the characteristics of the system and tagging datasets and to determine the potential areas for further system development."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7367","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7367","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7368","fieldValue":" Social network analysis has attracted increasing attention in recent years. In many social networks, besides friendship links among users, the phenomenon of users associating themselves with groups or communities is common. Thus, two networks exist simultaneously: the friendship network among users, and the affiliation network between users and groups. In this article, we tackle the affiliation recommendation problem, where the task is to predict or suggest new affiliations between users and communities, given the current state of the friendship and affiliation networks. More generally, affiliations need not be community affiliations---they can be a userâ\u20AC™s taste, so affiliation recommendation algorithms have applications beyond community recommendation. In this article, we show that information from the friendship network can indeed be fruitfully exploited in making affiliation recommendations. Using a simple way of combining these networks, we suggest two models of user-community affinity for the purpose of making affiliation recommendations: one based on graph proximity, and another using latent factors to model users and communities. We explore the affiliation recommendation algorithms suggested by these models and evaluate these algorithms on two real-world networks, Orkut and Youtube. In doing so, we motivate and propose a way of evaluating recommenders, by measuring how good the top 50 recommendations are for the average user, and demonstrate the importance of choosing the right evaluation strategy. The algorithms suggested by the graph proximity model turn out to be the most effective. We also introduce scalable versions of these algorithms, and demonstrate their effectiveness. This use of link prediction techniques for the purpose of affiliation recommendation is, to our knowledge, novel."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7368","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7368","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7369","fieldValue":"McNally, Kevin"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7369","fieldValue":"OMahony, Michael P"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7369","fieldValue":" Although collaborative searching is not supported by mainstream search engines, recent research has highlighted the inherently collaborative nature of many Web search tasks. In this article, we describe HeyStaks, a collaborative Web search framework that is designed to complement mainstream search engines. At search time, HeyStaks learns from the search activities of other users and leverages this information to generate recommendations based on results that others have found relevant for similar searches. The key contribution of this article is to extend the HeyStaks social search model by considering the search expertise, or reputation, of HeyStaks users and using this information to enhance the result recommendation process. In particular, we propose a reputation model for HeyStaks users that utilise the implicit collaboration events that take place between users as recommendations are made and selected. We describe a live-user trial of HeyStaks that demonstrates the relevance of its core recommendations and the ability of the reputation model to further improve recommendation quality. Our findings indicate that incorporating reputation into the recommendation process further improves the relevance of HeyStaks recommendations by up to 40&percnt;."}
