The software provides appropriate functionality for users with physical, speech, and language impairments to generate and tell novel punning riddles at different levels of complexity. STANDUP was evaluated with nine children with cerebral palsy during an eight-week study. Results show that the participants were able to generate and tell novel jokes with minimal or no support. The use of STANDUP impacted favorably on general AAC use. The study results also suggested that STANDUP could potentially have a positive effect on social and pragmatic skills. Further research to investigate the impact of STANDUP on communication skills is proposed. Suggestions for future software development include providing users with opportunities to complete jokes and to integrate online dictionaries when new vocabulary is encountered."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1419","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1419","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4909","fieldValue":" The aim of this study was to analyze previously published gene expression data of skeletal muscle biopsies of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients and controls (gene expression omnibus database, accession #GSE6011) using systems biology approaches. We applied an unsupervised method to discriminate patient and control populations, based on principal component analysis, using the gene expressions as units and patients as variables. The genes having the highest absolute scores in the discrimination between the groups, were then analyzed in terms of gene expression networks, on the basis of their mutual correlation in the two groups. The correlation network structures suggest two different modes of gene regulation in the two groups, reminiscent of important aspects of DMD pathogenesis."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4909","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4909","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4909","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4910","fieldValue":" Clustering validation indexes are intended to assess the goodness of clustering results. Many methods used to estimate the number of clusters rely on a validation index as a key element to find the correct answer. This paper presents a new validation index based on graph concepts, which has been designed to find arbitrary shaped clusters by exploiting the spatial layout of the patterns and their clustering label. This new clustering index is combined with a solid statistical detection framework, the gap statistic. The resulting method is able to find the right number of arbitrary-shaped clusters in diverse situations, as we show with examples where this information is available. A comparison with several relevant validation methods is carried out using artificial and gene expression data sets. The results are very encouraging, showing that the underlying structure in the data can be more accurately detected with the new clustering index. Our gene expression data results also indicate that this new index is stable under perturbation of the input data."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4910","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4910","fieldValue":"Indexes,Clustering algorithms,Shape,Equations,Kernel,Bars,Algorithm design and analysis,genomic data,Validation index,clustering"}
