{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13043","fieldValue":" We propose the probabilistic transfer matrix (PTM) framework to capture nondeterministic behavior in logic circuits. PTMs provide a concise description of both normal and faulty behavior, and are well-suited to reliability and error susceptibility calculations. A few simple composition rules based on connectivity can be used to recursively build larger PTMs (representing entire logic circuits) from smaller gate PTMs. PTMs for gates in series are combined using matrix multiplication, and PTMs for gates in parallel are combined using the tensor product operation. PTMs can accurately calculate joint output probabilities in the presence of reconvergent fanout and inseparable joint input distributions. To improve computational efficiency, we encode PTMs as algebraic decision diagrams (ADDs). We also develop equivalent ADD algorithms for newly defined matrix operations such as eliminate_variables and eliminate_redundant_variables, which aid in the numerical computation of circuit PTMs. We use PTMs to evaluate circuit reliability and derive polynomial approximations for circuit error probabilities in terms of gate error probabilities. PTMs can also analyze the effects of logic and electrical masking on error mitigation. We show that ignoring logic masking can overestimate errors by an order of magnitude. We incorporate electrical masking by computing error attenuation probabilities, based on analytical models, into an extended PTM framework for reliability computation. We further define a susceptibility measure to identify gates whose errors are not well masked. We show that hardening a few gates can significantly improve circuit reliability."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13043","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13043","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13044","fieldValue":"Tzeng, Chao-Wen"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13044","fieldValue":"Yang, Jheng-Syun"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13044","fieldValue":"Huang, Shi-Yu"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13044","fieldValue":" Scan chains are popularly used as the channels for silicon testing and debugging. However, they have also been identified as one of the culprits of silicon failure more recently. To cope with this problem, several scan chain diagnosis approaches have been proposed in the past. The existing methods, however, suffer from one common drawbackâ\u20AC\u201Dthat is, they rely on fault models and matching heuristics to locate the faults. Such a paradigm may run into difficulty when the fault under diagnosis does not match the fault model exactly, for example, when there is a bridging between a flip-flop and a logic cell, or the fault is temporal and only manifests itself intermittently. In light of this, we propose in this article a more versatile model-free paradigm for locating the faulty flip-flops in a scan chain, incorporating a number of signal processing techniques, such as filtering and edge detection. These techniques performed on the test responses of the failing chip under diagnosis directly can effectively reveal the fault location(s) in a scan chain. As compared to the previous works, our approach is better capable of handling intermittent faults and bridging faults, even under nonideal conditions, for example, when the core logic is also faulty. Experimental results on several real designs indicate that this approach can indeed catch some nasty faults that previous methods could not catch."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13044","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13044","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13045","fieldValue":" Single Chip Heterogeneous Multiprocessors executing a wide variety of software are increasingly common in consumer electronics. Because of the mix of real-time and best effort software across the entire chip, a key design element of these systems is the choice of scheduling strategy. Without task migration, the benefits of single chip processing cannot be fully realized. Previously, high-level modeling environments have not been capable of modeling asynchronous events such as interrupts and preemptive scheduling while preserving the performance benefits of high level simulation. This paper shows how extensions to Modeling Environment for Software and Hardware (MESH) enable precise modeling of these asynchronous events while running more than 1000 faster than cycle-accurate simulation. We discuss how we achieved this and illustrate its use in modeling preemptive scheduling. We evaluate the potential of migrating running tasks between processors to improve performance in a multimedia cell phone example. We show that by allowing schedulers to rebalance processor loads as new tasks arrive significant performance gains can be achieved over statically partitioned and dynamic scheduling approaches. In our example, we show that system response time can be improved by as much as 1.96 times when a preemptive migratory scheduler is used, despite the overhead incurred by scheduling tasks across multiple processors and transferring state during the migration of running tasks. The contribution of this work is to provide a framework for evaluating preemptive scheduling policies and task migration in a high level simulator, by combining the new ability to model interrupts with dramatically increased efficiency in the high-level modeling of scheduling and commuincation MESH already provides."}
