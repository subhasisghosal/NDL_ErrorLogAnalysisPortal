{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22257","fieldValue":" We construct two new multiparty digital signature schemes that allow multiple signers to sequentially and non-interactively produce a compact, fixed-length signature. First, we introduce a new primitive that we call ordered multisignature (OMS) scheme, which allows signers to attest to a common message as well as the order in which they signed. Our OMS construction substantially improves computational efficiency and scalability over any existing scheme with suitable functionality. Second, we design a new identity-based sequential aggregate signature scheme, where signers can attest to different messages and signature verification does not require knowledge of traditional public keys. The latter property permits savings on bandwidth and storage as compared to public-key solutions. In contrast to the only prior scheme to provide this functionality, ours offers improved security that does not rely on synchronized clocks or a trusted first signer. We provide formal security definitions and support the proposed schemes with security proofs under appropriate computational assumptions. We focus on applications of our schemes to secure network routing, but we believe that they will find other applications as well."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22257","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22257","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/22258","fieldValue":"Daniels, Thomas E"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22258","fieldValue":" In this article we develop a novel graph-based approach toward network forensics analysis. Central to our approach is the evidence graph model that facilitates evidence presentation and automated reasoning. Based on the evidence graph, we propose a hierarchical reasoning framework that consists of two levels. Local reasoning aims to infer the functional states of network entities from local observations. Global reasoning aims to identify important entities from the graph structure and extract groups of densely correlated participants in the attack scenario. This article also presents a framework for interactive hypothesis testing, which helps to identify the attacker's nonexplicit attack activities from secondary evidence. We developed a prototype system that implements the techniques discussed. Experimental results on various attack datasets demonstrate that our analysis mechanism achieves good coverage and accuracy in attack group and scenario extraction with less dependence on hard-coded expert knowledge."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22258","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22258","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/22259","fieldValue":"Halpern, Joseph Y"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/22259","fieldValue":"ONeill, Kevin R"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22259","fieldValue":" We introduce a general framework for reasoning about secrecy requirements in multiagent systems. Our definitions extend earlier definitions of secrecy and nondeducibility given by Shannon and Sutherland. Roughly speaking, one agent maintains secrecy with respect to another if the second agent cannot rule out any possibilities for the behavior or state of the first agent. We show that the framework can handle probability and nondeterminism in a clean way, is useful for reasoning about asynchronous systems as well as synchronous systems, and suggests generalizations of secrecy that may be useful for dealing with issues such as resource-bounded reasoning. We also show that a number of well-known attempts to characterize the absence of information flow are special cases of our definitions of secrecy."}
