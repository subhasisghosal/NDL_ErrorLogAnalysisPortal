This problem is often illustrated by the gathering problem, where the robots must self-organize and meet at some location not determined in advance, and without the help of some global coordinate system. While very simple to express, this problem has the advantage of retaining the inherent difficulty of agreement, namely the question of breaking symmetry between robots. In previous works, it has been proved that the gathering problem is solvable in asynchronous model with oblivious (i.e., memory-less) robots and limited visibility, as long as the robots share the knowledge of some direction, as provided by a compass. However, the problem has no solution in the semi-synchronous model when robots do not share a compass, or when they cannot detect multiplicity. In this article, we define a model in which compasses may be unreliable, and study the solvability of gathering oblivious mobile robots with limited visibility in the semi-synchronous model. In particular, we give an algorithm that solves the problem in finite time in a system where compasses are unstable for some arbitrary long periods, provided that they stabilize eventually. In addition, we show that our algorithm solves the gathering problem for at most three robots in the asynchronous model. Our algorithm is intrinsically self-stabilizing."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1162","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1162","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2344","fieldValue":" We consider a fault-tolerant generalization of the classical uncapacitated facility location problem, where each client j has a requirement that $r_j distinct facilities serve it, instead of just one. We give a 2.076-approximation algorithm for this problem using LP rounding, which is currently the best-known performance guarantee. Our algorithm exploits primal and dual complementary slackness conditions and is based on clustered randomized rounding. A technical difficulty that we overcome is the presence of terms with negative coefficients in the dual objective function, which makes it difficult to bound the cost in terms of dual variables. For the case where all requirements are the same, we give a primal-dual 1.52-approximation algorithm. We also consider a fault-tolerant version of the k-median problem. In the metric k-median problem, we are given n points in a metric space. We must select k of these to be centers, and then assign each input point j to the selected center that is closest to it. In the fault-tolerant version we want j to be assigned to rj$ distinct centers. The goal is to select the k centers so as to minimize the sum of assignment costs. The primal-dual algorithm for fault-tolerant facility location with uniform requirements also yields a 4-approximation algorithm for the fault-tolerant k-median problem for this case. This the first constant-factor approximation algorithm for the uniform requirements case."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/2344","fieldValue":"<i>k<\/i>-median problem"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_LOWER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2344","fieldValue":"<i>k<\/i>-median problem"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2344","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2344","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14192","fieldValue":" We describe the tools and theory of a comprehensive system for database design, and show how they work together to support multiple conceptual and logical design processes. The Database Design and Evaluation Workbench (DDEW) system uses a rigorous, information-content-preserving approach to schema transformation, but combines it with heuristics, guess work, and user interactions. The main contribution lies in illustrating how theory was adapted to a practical system, and how the consistency and power of a design system can be increased by use of theory.First, we explain why a design system needs multiple data models, and how implementation over a unified underlying model reduces redundancy and inconsistency. Second, we present a core set of small but fundamental algorithms that reaarange a schema without changing its information content. From these reusable components, we easily built larger tools and transformations that were still formally justified. Third, we describe heuristic tools that attempt to improve a schema, often by adding missing information. In these tools, unreliable techniques such as normalization and relationship inference are bolstered by system-guided user interactions to remove errors. We present a rigorous criterion for identifying unnecessary relationships, and discuss an interactive view integrator. Last, we examine the relevance of database theory to building these practically motivated tools and contrast the paradigms of system builders with those of theoreticians."}
