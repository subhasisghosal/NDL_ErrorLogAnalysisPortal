{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3665","fieldValue":" This paper addresses the problem of sound-source localization from time-delay estimates using arbitrarily-shaped non-coplanar microphone arrays. A novel geometric formulation is proposed, together with a thorough algebraic analysis and a global optimization solver. The proposed model is thoroughly described and evaluated. The geometric analysis, stemming from the direct acoustic propagation model, leads to necessary and sufficient conditions for a set of time delays to correspond to a unique position in the source space. Such sets of time delays are referred to as feasible sets. We formally prove that every feasible set corresponds to exactly one position in the source space, whose value can be recovered using a closed-form localization mapping. Therefore we seek for the optimal feasible set of time delays given, as input, the received microphone signals. This time delay estimation problem is naturally cast into a programming task, constrained by the feasibility conditions derived from the geometric analysis. A global branch-and-bound optimization technique is proposed to solve the problem at hand, hence estimating the best set of feasible time delays and, subsequently, localizing the sound source. Extensive experiments with both simulated and real data are reported; we compare our methodology to four state-of-the-art techniques. This comparison shows that the proposed method combined with the branch-and-bound algorithm outperforms existing methods. These in-depth geometric understanding, practical algorithms, and encouraging results, open several opportunities for future work."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3665","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3665","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/1277","fieldValue":"Leung, Ho-Fung"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1277","fieldValue":" In multiagent systems, social optimality is a desirable goal to achieve in terms of maximizing the global efficiency of the system. We study the problem of coordinating on socially optimal outcomes among a population of agents, in which each agent randomly interacts with another agent from the population each round. Previous work [Hales and Edmonds 2003; Matlock and Sen 2007, 2009] mainly resorts to modifying the interaction protocol from random interaction to tag-based interactions and only focus on the case of symmetric games. Besides, in previous work the agentsâ\u20AC™ decision making processes are usually based on evolutionary learning, which usually results in high communication cost and high deviation on the coordination rate. To solve these problems, we propose an alternative social learning framework with two major contributions as follows. First, we introduce the observation mechanism to reduce the amount of communication required among agents. Second, we propose that the agentsâ\u20AC™ learning strategies should be based on reinforcement learning technique instead of evolutionary learning. Each agent explicitly keeps the record of its current state in its learning strategy, and learn its optimal policy for each state independently. In this way, the learning performance is much more stable and also it is suitable for both symmetric and asymmetric games. The performance of this social learning framework is extensively evaluated under the testbed of two-player general-sum games comparing with previous work [Hao and Leung 2011; Matlock and Sen 2007]. The influences of different factors on the learning performance of the social learning framework are investigated as well."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1277","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1277","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3666","fieldValue":" In this contribution, the problem of broadband acoustic signal extraction is treated as a specific source separation problem, where the desired signal components are to be separated from all remaining undesired components. For this, we exploit the generic TRIple-N Independent component analysis for CONvolutive mixtures (TRINICON) framework. The TRINICON optimization criterion is complemented with linear constraints leading to the Linearly Constrained Minimum Mutual Information (LCMMI) criterion for desired signal extraction. A general linearly constrained update rule for iterative filter optimization is derived, which can efficiently be realized in a novel Minimum Mutual Information (MMI)-Generalized Sidelobe Canceler (GSC). The general treatment of the signal extraction problem using an MMI criterion provides several advantages: Firstly, new insights into the signal extraction problem can be derived by establishing links to both the original GSC and the Multichannel Wiener Filter (MWF). Secondly, by exploiting fundamental properties characteristic for speech and audio signals, complicated and often unreliable Voice Activity Detection (VAD)-based control mechanisms become unnecessary. Thirdly, the overall realization requires only prior information of the desired source position. An evaluation of the MMI-GSC for the double-talk situation with two concurrently active speech sources under reverberant and noisy conditions demonstrates the effectiveness of this novel approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3666","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3666","fieldValue":"ACM"}
