With limited local information about the network, each node's knowledge is mismatched; therefore, they must make distributed decisions. In this paper, we pose the following question: If every node has network state information only about a small neighborhood, how and when should nodes choose to transmit? While link scheduling answers the above question for point-to-point physical layers that are designed for an interference-avoidance paradigm, we look for answers in cases when interference can be embraced by advanced PHY-layer design, as suggested by results in network information theory. To make progress on this challenging problem, we propose a constructive distributed algorithm that achieves rates higher than link scheduling based on interference avoidance, especially if each node knows more than one hop of network state information. We compare our new aggressive algorithm to a conservative algorithm we have presented in a 2013 conference paper. Both algorithms schedule subnetworks such that each subnetwork can employ advanced interference-embracing coding schemes to achieve higher rates. Our innovation is in the identification, selection, and scheduling of subnetworks, especially when subnetworks are larger than a single link."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10874","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10874","fieldValue":"Leveraging physical-layer capabilites: distributed scheduling in interference networks with local views"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10874","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10874","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10875","fieldValue":" We study the optimal control problem of maximizing the spread of an information epidemic on a social network. Information propagation is modeled as a susceptible-infected (SI) process, and the campaign budget is fixed. Direct recruitment and word-of-mouth incentives are the two strategies to accelerate information spreading (controls). We allow for multiple controls depending on the degree of the nodes\/individuals. The solution optimally allocates the scarce resource over the campaign duration and the degree class groups. We study the impact of the degree distribution of the network on the controls and present results for Erd≈\u2018s-R√©nyi and scale-free networks. Results show that more resource is allocated to high-degree nodes in the case of scale-free networks, but medium-degree nodes in the case of Erd≈\u2018s-R√©nyi networks. We study the effects of various model parameters on the optimal strategy and quantify the improvement offered by the optimal strategy over the static and bang-bang control strategies. The effect of the time-varying spreading rate on the controls is explored as the interest level of the population in the subject of the campaign may change over time. We show the existence of a solution to the formulated optimal control problem, which has nonlinear isoperimetric constraints, using novel techniques that is general and can be used in other similar optimal control problems. This work may be of interest to political, social awareness, or crowdfunding campaigners and product marketing managers, and with some modifications may be used for mitigating biological epidemics."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10875","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/10875","fieldValue":"Erd&#337;s-R&#233;nyi networks"}
