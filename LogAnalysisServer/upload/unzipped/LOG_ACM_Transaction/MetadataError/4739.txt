{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25285","fieldValue":" We consider the problem of flow coordination in distributed multimedia applications. Most transport-level protocols are designed to operate independently and lack mechanisms for sharing information with other flows and coordinating data transport in various ways. This limitation becomes problematic in distributed applications that employ numerous flows between two computing clusters sharing the same intermediary forwarding path across the Internet. In this article, we propose an open architecture that supports the sharing of network state information, peer flow information, and application-specific information. Called simply the coordination protocol (CP), the scheme facilitates coordination of network resource usage across flows belonging to the same application, as well as aiding other types of coordination. The effectiveness of our approach is illustrated in the context of multistreaming in 3D tele-immersion where consistency of network information across flows both greatly improves frame transport synchrony and minimizes buffering delay."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25285","fieldValue":"An open architecture for transport-level protocol coordination in distributed multimedia applications"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25285","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25285","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25286","fieldValue":" For the past decade, there have been numerous research works focusing on the protection of digital images, audio, video, 3D virtual scenes, and software data from unauthorized use and distribution. With the emerging technology of the MPEG-4 standard, MPEG-4 scenes that may include images, video, audio, and 3D objects can easily be built using the text-based MPEG-4 XMT standard. XMT allows content authors to exchange their content with other authors, tools, or service providers and facilitates interoperability with MPEG-4, X3D, and SMIL. In order for owners and designers to protect and\/or authenticate their work, some form of security needs to be applied into the MPEG-4 XMT structure and its media content. Unlike images or videos, watermarking an XMT structure is not an easy task, since the structure contains no noise components to embed the watermark. This article is the first one proposing a novel robust algorithm for the authentication of a given MPEG-4 XMT structured scene and the location of its multimedia content."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25286","fieldValue":"VRML"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25286","fieldValue":"XML"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25286","fieldValue":"XMT"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25286","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25286","fieldValue":"ACM"}
