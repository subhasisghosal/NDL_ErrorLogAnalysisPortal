The pursuit to compute mappings that are injective and have a controllable amount of conformal and isometric distortion is a long endeavor which has received significant attention by the scientific community in recent years. The difficulty of the problem stems from the fact that the space of bounded distortion mappings is nonconvex. In this paper, we consider the special case of harmonic mappings which have been used extensively in many graphics applications. We show that, somewhat surprisingly, the space of locally injective planar harmonic mappings with bounded conformal and isometric distortion has a convex characterization. We describe several projection operators that, given an arbitrary input mapping, are guaranteed to output a bounded distortion locally injective harmonic mapping that is closest to the input mapping in some special sense. In contrast to alternative approaches, the optimization problems that correspond to our projection operators are shown to be always feasible for any choice of distortion bounds. We use the boundary element method (BEM) to discretize the space of planar harmonic mappings and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through the application of planar shape deformation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17594","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17594","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17595","fieldValue":" UV-maps are required in order to apply a 2D texture over a 3D model. Conventional UV-maps are defined by an assignment of uv positions to mesh vertices. We present an alternative representation, volume-encoded UV-maps, in which each point on the surface is mapped to a uv position which is solely a function of its 3D position. This function is tailored for a target surface: its restriction to the surface is a parametrization exhibiting high quality, e.g. in terms of angle and area preservation; and, near the surface, it is almost constant for small orthogonal displacements. The representation is applicable to a wide range of shapes and UV-maps, and unlocks several key advantages: it removes the need to duplicate vertices in the mesh to encode cuts in the map; it makes the UV-map representation independent from the meshing of the surface; the same texture, and even the same UV-map, can be shared by multiple geometrically similar models (e.g. all levels of a LoD pyramid); UV-maps can be applied to representations other than polygonal meshes, like point clouds or set of registered range-maps. Our schema is cheap on GPU computational and memory resources, requiring only a single, cache-coherent indirection to a small volumetric texture per fragment. We also provide an algorithm to construct a volume-encoded UV-map given a target surface."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/17595","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: Universit&#224; dell'Insubria, Varese (Tarini, Marco)"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17595","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17595","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17596","fieldValue":" Scanned performances are commonly represented in virtual environments as sequences of textured triangle meshes. Detailed shapes deforming over time benefit from meshes with dynamically evolving connectivity. We analyze these unstructured mesh sequences to automatically synthesize motion graphs with new smooth transitions between compatible poses and actions. Such motion graphs enable natural periodic motions, stochastic playback, and user-directed animations. The main challenge of unstructured sequences is that the meshes differ not only in connectivity but also in alignment, shape, and texture. We introduce new geometry processing techniques to address these problems and demonstrate visually seamless transitions on high-quality captures."}
