FAR features face-routing and timed-forwarding for delivering a message to a mobile delivery zone. Both analytical and statistical results show that FAR achieves reliable spatial and just-in-time message delivery with only moderate communication and memory overhead. This article also presents a novel distributed algorithm for spatial neighborhood discovery for FAR bootstrapping. The spatiotemporal performance and reliability of FAR are demonstrated via network simulations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21180","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21180","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21181","fieldValue":" In this article, we explore the fundamental limits of sensor network lifetime that all algorithms can possibly achieve. Specifically, under the assumptions that nodes are deployed as a Poisson point process with density Î» in a square region with side length &ell; and each sensor can cover a unit-area disk, we first derive the necessary and sufficient condition of the node density in order to maintain complete k-coverage with probability approaching 1. With this result, we obtain that if Î» &equals; log $&ell;^2 &plus; (k &plus; 2)loglog &ell;2$ &plus; c(&ell;), c(&ell;) â\u2020\u2019 âˆ\u2019âˆž, as &ell; â\u2020\u2019 &plus; âˆž, the sensor network lifetime (for maintaining complete coverage) is upper bounded by kT with probability approaching 1 as &ell; â\u2020\u2019 &plus; âˆž, where T is the lifetime of a single sensor. Second, we derive, given a fixed node density in a finite (but reasonably large) region, the upper bounds of lifetime when only Î±-portion of the region is covered at any time. We also carry out several sets of experiments to validate the derived theoretical results. Numerical results indicate that the derived upper bounds apply not only to networks of large sizes and homogeneous nodal distributions but also to small size networks with clustering nodal distributions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21181","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21181","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21182","fieldValue":" This article considers the problem of distributing sensors to observe a random field while meeting a series of energy and coverage constraints. In the network under consideration, N identical sensors are to be distributed, with each sensor sending data to a single fusion center at a fixed rate Î\u201D R. The problem of sensor allocation to the coverage area is reduced to the problem of allocating sensors to cells by first partitioning the coverage field into cells, and then assuming that sensors in the same cells make the same observations. It is shown that the resulting sensor allocation problem is equivalent to a discrete form of the rate allocation problem, a well-known problem in the field of information theory. General guidelines for solving this problem are provided."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21182","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21182","fieldValue":"ACM"}
