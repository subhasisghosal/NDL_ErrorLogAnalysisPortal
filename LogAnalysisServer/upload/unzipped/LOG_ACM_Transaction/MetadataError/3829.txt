In this article we apply association rule mining to the history of accesses to predict changes to access-control policies that are likely to be consistent with users' intentions, so that these changes can be instituted in advance of misconfigurations interfering with legitimate accesses. Instituting these changes requires the consent of the appropriate administrator, of course, and so a primary contribution of our work is how to automatically determine from whom to seek consent and how to minimize the costs of doing so. We show using data from a deployed access-control system that our methods can reduce the number of accesses that would have incurred costly time-of-access delays by 43&percnt;, and can correctly predict 58&percnt; of the intended policy. These gains are achieved without impacting the total amount of time users spend interacting with the system."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22319","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22319","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22320","fieldValue":" As distributed applications increase in size and complexity, traditional authorization architectures based on a dedicated authorization server become increasingly fragile because this decision point represents a single point of failure and a performance bottleneck. Authorization caching, which enables the reuse of previous authorization decisions, is one technique that has been used to address these challenges. This article introduces and evaluates the mechanisms for authorization â\u20ACœrecyclingâ\u20AC? in RBAC enterprise systems. The algorithms that support these mechanisms allow making precise and approximate authorization decisions, thereby masking possible failures of the authorization server and reducing its load. We evaluate these algorithms analytically as well as using simulation and a prototype implementation. Our evaluation results demonstrate that authorization recycling can improve the performance of distributed-access control mechanisms."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22320","fieldValue":"RBAC"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22320","fieldValue":"SAAM"}
