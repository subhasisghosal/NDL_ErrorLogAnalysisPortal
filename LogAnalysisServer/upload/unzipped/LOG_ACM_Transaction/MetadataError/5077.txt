In this paper, we focus on a class of blind batch methods for speech dereverberation in a noiseless scenario with a single source, which are based on multi-channel linear prediction in the short-time Fourier transform domain. Dereverberation is performed by maximum-likelihood estimation of the model parameters that are subsequently used to recover the desired speech signal. Contrary to the conventional method, we propose to model the desired speech signal using a general sparse prior that can be represented in a convex form as a maximization over scaled complex Gaussian distributions. The proposed model can be interpreted as a generalization of the commonly used time-varying Gaussian model. Furthermore, we reformulate both the conventional and the proposed method as an optimization problem with an $&ell;_p$-norm cost function, emphasizing the role of sparsity in the considered speech dereverberation methods. Experimental evaluation in different acoustic scenarios show that the proposed approach results in an improved performance compared to the conventional approach in terms of instrumental measures for speech quality."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3851","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3851","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3852","fieldValue":" In conventional single-channel speech enhancement, typically the noisy spectral amplitude is modified while the noisy phase is used to reconstruct the enhanced signal. Several recent attempts have shown the effectiveness of utilizing an improved spectral phase for phase-aware speech enhancement and consequently its positive impact on the perceived speech quality. In this paper, we present a harmonic phase estimation method relying on fundamental frequency and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) information estimated from noisy speech. The proposed method relies on SNR-based time-frequency smoothing of the unwrapped phase obtained from the decomposition of the noisy phase. To incorporate the uncertainty in the estimated phase due to unreliable voicing decision and SNR estimate, we propose a binary hypothesis test assuming speech-present and speech-absent classes representing high and low SNRs. The effectiveness of the proposed phase estimation method is evaluated for both phase-only enhancement of noisy speech and in combination with an amplitude-only enhancement scheme. We show that by enhancing the noisy phase both perceived speech quality as well as speech intelligibility are improved as predicted by the instrumental metrics and justified by subjective listening tests."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3852","fieldValue":"Harmonic phase estimation in single-channel speech enhancement using phase decomposition and SNR information"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3852","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3852","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3853","fieldValue":" Sentiment analysis, which addresses the computational treatment of opinion, sentiment, and subjectivity in text, has received considerable attention in recent years. In contrast to the traditional coarse-grained sentiment analysis tasks, such as document-level sentiment classification, we are interested in the fine-grained aspect-based sentiment analysis that aims to identify aspects that users comment on and these aspects' polarities. Aspect-based sentiment analysis relies heavily on syntactic features. However, the reviews that this task focuses on are natural and spontaneous, thus posing a challenge to syntactic parsers. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a framework of adding a sentiment sentence compression (Sent_Comp) step before performing the aspect-based sentiment analysis. Different from the previous sentence compression model for common news sentences, Sent_Comp seeks to remove the sentiment-unnecessary information for sentiment analysis, thereby compressing a complicated sentiment sentence into one that is shorter and easier to parse. We apply a discriminative conditional random field model, with certain special features, to automatically compress sentiment sentences. Using the Chinese corpora of four product domains, Sent_Comp significantly improves the performance of the aspect-based sentiment analysis. The features proposed for Sent_Comp, especially the potential semantic features, are useful for sentiment sentence compression."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3853","fieldValue":"ACM"}
