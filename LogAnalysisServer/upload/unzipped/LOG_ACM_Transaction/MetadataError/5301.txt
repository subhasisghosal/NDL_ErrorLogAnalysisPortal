This paper is meant to serve as an initial guide for both the biologists interested in formal approaches and the mathematicians or computer scientists wishing to inject more realism into their models. The paper is focused on the structural aspects of metabolism only. The literature is vast enough already, and the thread through it difficult to follow even for the more experienced worker in the field. We explain methods for acquiring data and reconstructing metabolic networks, and review the various models that have been used for their structural analysis. Several concepts such as modularity are introduced, as are the controversies that have beset the field these past few years, for instance, on whether metabolic networks are small-world or scale-free, and on which model better explains the evolution of metabolism. Clarifying the work that has been done also helps in identifying open questions and in proposing relevant future directions in the field, which we do along the paper and in the conclusion."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4389","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4389","fieldValue":"Introductory and Survey, Graph Theory, Biology and genetics, metabolic networks, modularity, evolution, reconstruction, modelling"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4389","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4389","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4390","fieldValue":" The incomplete perfect phylogeny (IPP) problem and the incomplete perfect phylogeny haplotyping (IPPH) problem deal with constructing a phylogeny for a given set of haplotypes or genotypes with missing entries. The earlier approaches for both of these problems dealt with restricted versions of the problems, where the root is either available or can be trivially re-constructed from the data, or certain assumptions were made about the data. In this paper, we deal with the unrestricted versions of the problems, where the root of the phylogeny is neither available nor trivially recoverable from the data. Both IPP and IPPH problems have previously been proven to be NPcomplete. Here, we present efficient enumerative algorithms that can handle practical instances of the problem. Empirical analysis on simulated data shows that the algorithms perform very well both in terms of speed and in terms accuracy of the recovered data."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4390","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4390","fieldValue":"ACM"}
