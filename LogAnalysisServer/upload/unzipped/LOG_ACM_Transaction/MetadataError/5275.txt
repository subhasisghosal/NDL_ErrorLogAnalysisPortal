With the creation of larger datasets, the automated recalibration of mass spectra becomes important to ensure that every peak in the sample spectrum is correctly assigned to some peptide and protein. Algorithms for recalibrating mass spectra have to be robust with respect to wrongly assigned peaks, as well as efficient due to the amount of mass spectrometry data. The recalibration of mass spectra leads us to the problem of finding an optimal matching between mass spectra under measurement errors.We have developed two deterministic methods that allow robust computation of such a matching: The first approach uses a computational geometry interpretation of the problem, and tries to find two parallel lines with constant distance that stab a maximal number of points in the plane. The second approach is based on finding a maximal common approximate subsequence, and improves existing algorithms by one order of magnitude exploiting the sequential nature of the matching problem. We compare our results to a computational geometry algorithm using a topological line-sweep."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4340","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4340","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4340","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4341","fieldValue":" A haplotype is an m-long binary vector. The xor-genotype of two haplotypes is the m-vector of their coordinate-wise xor. We study the following problem: Given a set of xor-genotypes, reconstruct their haplotypes so that the set of resulting haplotypes can be mapped onto a perfect phylogeny tree. The question is motivated by studying population evolution in human genetics, and is a variant of the perfect phylogeny haplotyping problem that has received intensive attention recently. Unlike the latter problem, in which the input is \"full\" genotypes, here we assume less informative input, and so may be more economical to obtain experimentally.Building on ideas of Gusfield, we show how to solve the problem in polynomial time, by a reduction to the graph realization problem. The actual haplotypes are not uniquely determined by that tree they map onto, and the tree itself may or may not be unique. We show that tree uniqueness implies uniquely determined haplotypes, up to inherent degrees of freedom, and give a sufficient condition for the uniqueness. To actually determine the haplotypes given the tree, additional information is necessary. We show that two or three full genotypes suffice to reconstruct all the haplotypes, and present a linear algorithm for identifying those genotypes."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4341","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4341","fieldValue":"ACM"}
