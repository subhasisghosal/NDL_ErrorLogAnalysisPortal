Using these metrics, we show that systems with heavy-tailed lifetime distributions are more resilient than those with light-tailed (e.g., exponential) distributions and that for a given average degree, k-regular graphs exhibit the highest level of fault tolerance. As a practical illustration of our results, each user in a system with n = 100 billion peers, 30-minute average lifetime, and 1-minute node-replacement delay can stay connected to the graph with probability 1 - 1\/n using only 9 neighbors. This is in contrast to 37 neighbors required under previous modeling efforts. We finish the paper by observing that many P2P networks are almost surely (i.e., with probability 1 -- o(1)) connected if they have no isolated nodes and derive a simple model for the probability that a P2P system partitions under churn."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9621","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9621","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9621","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/9622","fieldValue":"Cheng, Yuan-Sheng"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9622","fieldValue":" We consider the fundamental delay bounds for scheduling packets in an N Ã\u2014 N packet switch operating under the crossbar constraint. Algorithms that make scheduling decisions without considering queue backlog are shown to incur an average delay of at leastO(N). We then prove that O(log(N)) delay is achievable with a simple frame based algorithm that uses queue backlog information. This is the best known delay bound for packet switches, and is the first analytical proof that sublinear delay is achievable in a packet switch with random inputs."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9622","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9622","fieldValue":"ACM"}
