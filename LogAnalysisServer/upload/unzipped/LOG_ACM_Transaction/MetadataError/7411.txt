Increases in static and dynamic variations are leading to higher probability of parametric and wear-out failures and are elevating reliability into a prime design constraint. In particular, SRAM cells used to build caches that dominate the processor area are usually minimum sized and more prone to failure. It is therefore of paramount importance to develop effective methodologies that facilitate the exploration of reliability techniques for caches. To this end, we present an analytical model that can determine for a given cache configuration, address trace, and random probability of permanent cell failure the exact expected miss rate and its standard deviation when blocks with faulty bits are disabled. What distinguishes our model is that it is fully analytical, it avoids the use of fault maps, and yet, it is both exact and simpler than previous approaches. The analytical model is used to produce the miss-rate trends (expected miss-rate) for future technology nodes for both uncorrelated and clustered faults. Some of the key findings based on the proposed model are (i) block disabling has a negligible impact on the expected miss-rate unless probability of failure is equal or greater than 2.6e-4, (ii) the fault map methodology can accurately calculate the expected miss-rate as long as 1,000 to 10,000 fault maps are used, and (iii) the expected miss-rate for execution of parallel applications increases with the number of threads and is more pronounced for a given probability of failure as compared to sequential execution."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1870","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1870","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9633","fieldValue":" We investigate reliable multipath provisioning of traffic in high-capacity backbone mesh networks, e.g., next-generation SONET\/SDH networks supporting virtual concatenation (VCAT). VCAT enables a connection to be inversely multiplexed on to multiple paths, a feature that may lead to significantly improved performance over conventional single-path provisioning. Other mesh networks such as those employing optical wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) and multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) can also benefit from this multipath provisioning approach. We propose effective multipath bandwidth as the metric to provision a connection while satisfying its reliability requirements (measured in terms of availability). We demonstrate that effective multipath bandwidth provides more flexibility and lower blocking probability without the cost and the complexity associated with traditional protection schemes developed for optical WDM and MPLS networks. We also investigate the practical problem of provisioning effective multipath bandwidth with cost constraints. We analyze the tractability of the problem and present a heuristic which results in significantly reduced number of blocked connections due to cost constraints."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9633","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9633","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9633","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9634","fieldValue":" This paper addresses the problem of optimal quality of service (QoS), traffic engineering (TE) and failure recovery (FR) in computer networks by introducing novel algorithms that only use source inferrable information. More precisely, optimal data rate adaptation and load balancing laws are provided which are applicable to networks where multiple paths are available and multiple classes of service (CoS) are to be provided. Different types of multiple paths are supported, including point-to-point multiple paths, point-to-multipoint multiple paths, and multicast trees. In particular, it is shown that the algorithms presented only need a minimal amount of information for optimal control, i.e., whether a path is congested or not. Hence, the control laws provided in this paper allow source inferred congestion detection without the need for explicit congestion feedback from the network. The proposed approach is applicable to utility functions of a very general form and endows the network with the important property of robustness with respect to node\/link failures; i.e., upon the occurrence of such a failure, the presented control laws reroute traffic away from the inoperative node\/link and converge to the optimal allocation for the \"reduced\" network. The proposed control laws set the foundation for the development of highly scalable feature-rich traffic control protocols at the IP, transport, or higher layers with provable global stability and convergence properties."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9634","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
