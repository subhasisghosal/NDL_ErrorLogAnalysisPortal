Simply put, DOS involves a process of joint channel probing and distributed scheduling for ad hoc (peer-to-peer) communications. Since, in practice, link conditions are estimated with noisy observations, the transmission rate must be backed off from the estimated rate in order to avoid transmission outages. Then, a natural question to ask is whether or not it is worthwhile for the link with successful contention to perform further channel probing to mitigate estimation errors, at the cost of additional probing. Thus motivated, this work investigates DOS with two-level channel probing by optimizing the tradeoff between the throughput gain from more accurate rate estimation and the resulting additional delay. By capitalizing on optimal stopping theory with incomplete information, it is shown that the optimal scheduling policy is threshold-based and is characterized by either one or two thresholds, depending on network settings. Necessary and sufficient conditions for both cases are rigorously established. In particular, this analysis reveals that performing second-level channel probing is optimal when the first-level estimated channel condition falls in between the two thresholds. Numerical results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed DOS with two-level channel probing. This study is also extended to the case with limited feedback, in which the feedback from the receiver to its transmitter takes the form of (0, 1, e)."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10071","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10071","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10071","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10072","fieldValue":" TCP has traditionally been considered inappropriate for real-time applications. Nonetheless, popular applications such as Skype use TCP since UDP packets cannot pass through restrictive network address translators (NATs) and firewalls. Motivated by this observation, we study the delay performance of TCP for real-time media flows. We develop an analytical performance model for the delay of TCP. We use extensive experiments to validate the model and to evaluate the impact of various TCP mechanisms on its delay performance. Based on our results, we derive the working region for VoIP and live video streaming applications and provide guidelines for delay-friendly TCP settings. Our research indicates that simple application-level schemes, such as packet splitting and parallel connections, can reduce the delay of real-time TCP flows by as much as 30% and 90%, respectively."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10072","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10072","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10072","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10073","fieldValue":" Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) and Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) are time-division multiplexing technologies widely used in transport networks to provide bandwidth services. Dynamic service provisioning requires the use of online algorithms that automatically compute the path to be taken to satisfy the given service request. SDH\/SONET multiplexing structure imposes restrictions on the allocation of bandwidth. Bandwidth services mostly require protection so that they are resilient to failures in the network. Two types of protection techniques--namely, dedicated protection and shared protection--are commonly used to protect bandwidth. Also, SDH\/SONET provides standard protection mechanisms like linear MSP\/APS, MS-SPRing\/BLSR and SNCP\/UPSR. In shared protection, complete path information for all the existing connections has to be maintained to maximize sharing for future service requests. This information will be typically very large. To overcome this problem, a minimum information scenario is proposed as a tradeoff between maintaining less information and maximizing sharing. In this work, heuristic algorithms are proposed for dedicated and shared protection that take into account the above-mentioned factors. These algorithms use the path computation algorithms for SDH networks proposed in a previous work of the authors, which compute paths for service requests without considering protection. The performance is evaluated for different values for the relative weight of sharing for the complete and minimum information scenarios. An extension to these algorithms for satisfying bandwidth requests that use various inverse multiplexing techniques is also proposed."}
