This system is a prototype implementation intended to demonstrate the role of design repositories as part of a vision for the next generation of product development software systems. This research involves not only the creation of a prototype software system, but is part of a broader effort that also includes the development of a core product knowledge representation and that seeks to address terminological and semantic issues associated with computer-aided product development. This article focuses on the interfaces that have been developed to support authoring and navigation of the product models stored in design repositories as well as the software architecture and associated rationale that provide the framework on which the system is built."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24330","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24330","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3359","fieldValue":" In this article we evaluate the use of approximate visibility for efficient global illumination. Traditionally, accurate visibility is used in light transport. However, the indirect illumination we perceive on a daily basis is rarely of high-frequency nature, as the most significant aspect of light transport in real-world scenes is diffuse, and thus displays a smooth gradation. This raises the question of whether accurate visibility is perceptually necessary in this case. To answer this question, we conduct a psychophysical study on the perceptual influence of approximate visibility on indirect illumination. This study reveals that accurate visibility is not required and that certain approximations may be introduced."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3359","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3359","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24331","fieldValue":" Recently several authors have proposed stochastic evolutionary models for the growth of the Web graph and other networks that give rise to power-law distributions. These models are based on the notion of preferential attachment, leading to the â\u20ACœrich get richerâ\u20AC? phenomenon. We present a generalization of the basic model by allowing deletion of individual links and show that it also gives rise to a power-law distribution. We derive the mean-field equations for this stochastic model and show that, by examining a snapshot of the distribution at the steady state of the model, we are able to determine the extent to which link deletion has taken place and estimate the probability of deleting a link. Applying our model to actual Web graph data provides evidence of the extent to which link deletion has occurred. We also discuss a problem that frequently arises in estimating the power-law exponent from empirical data and a few possible methods for dealing with this, indicating our preferred approach. Using this approach our analysis of the data suggests a power-law exponent of approximately 2.15 for the distribution of inlinks in the Web graph, rather than the widely published value of 2.1."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24331","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24331","fieldValue":"ACM"}
