We model channel assignment as a coloring problem for spatial point processes in which n nodes are located in a unit cube uniformly at random and each node is assigned one of K colors, where each color represents a channel. The objective is to maximize the spatial separation between nodes of the same color. In general, it is hard to derive the optimal coloring algorithm, and we therefore consider a natural online greedy coloring algorithm first proposed by Ko and Rubenstein in 2005. We prove two key results: 1) with just log n\/log log n colors, the distance separation achieved by the greedy coloring algorithm asymptotically matches the optimal distance separation that can be achieved by an algorithm which is allowed to optimally place the nodes but is allowed to use only one color; and 2) when K = Î©(log n), the greedy coloring algorithm asymptotically achieves the best distance separation that can be achieved by an algorithm which is allowed to both optimally color and place nodes. The greedy coloring algorithm is also shown to dramatically outperform a simple random coloring algorithm. Moreover, the results continue to hold under node mobility."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10157","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10157","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10157","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10158","fieldValue":" Pareto optimality is an important property in game theory and mechanism design, which can be utilized to design resource allocation strategies in wireless systems. We analyze the structure of the boundary points of certain utility sets based on interference functions. We particularly investigate the cases with no power constraints, with individual power constraints, and with a total power constraint. We display the dependency between Pareto optimality and interference coupling in wireless systems. An axiomatic framework of interference functions and a global dependency matrix is used to characterize interference coupling in wireless systems. The relationship between interference-balancing functions and Pareto optimality of the boundary points is elucidated. Among other results, it is shown that the boundary points of utility sets with individual power constraints and with strictly monotonic interference functions are Pareto-optimal if and only if the corresponding restricted global dependency matrix is irreducible. The obtained results provide certain insight when suitable algorithms can be designed for network utility maximization."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10158","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10158","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10158","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10159","fieldValue":" Ethernet is becoming a preferred technology to be extended to metropolitan area networks (MANs) due to its low cost, simplicity, and ubiquity. However, current Ethernet lacks a fast failure recovery mechanism as it reconstructs the spanning tree after the failure is detected, which commonly requires tens of seconds. Some fast failure-handling methods based on multiple spanning trees have been proposed in the literature, but these approaches are either centralized or require periodic message broadcasting over the entire network. In this paper, we propose a local restoration mechanism for metro Ethernet using multiple spanning trees, which is distributed and fast and does not need failure notification. Upon failure of a single link, the upstream switch locally restores traffic to preconfigured backup spanning trees. We propose two restoration approaches, connection-based and destination-based, to select backup trees. We formulate the tree preconfiguration problem that includes working spanning tree assignment and backup spanning tree configuration. We prove that the preconfiguration problem is NP-complete and develop an integer linear programming model. We also develop heuristic algorithms for each restoration approach to reduce the computation complexity. To evaluate the effectiveness of our heuristic algorithms, we carry out the simulation on grid and random networks. The simulation results show that our heuristic algorithms have comparable performance close to the optimal solutions, and both restoration approaches can efficiently utilize the network bandwidth to handle single link failures."}
