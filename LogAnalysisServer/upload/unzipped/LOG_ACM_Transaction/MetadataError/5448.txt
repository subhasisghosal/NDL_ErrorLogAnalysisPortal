{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4663","fieldValue":" The common scenario in computational biology in which a community of researchers conduct multiple statistical tests on one shared database gives rise to the multiple hypothesis testing problem. Conventional procedures for solving this problem control the probability of false discovery by sacrificing some of the power of the tests. We suggest a scheme for controlling false discovery without any power loss by adding new samples for each use of the database and charging the user with the expenses. The crux of the scheme is a carefully crafted pricing system that fairly prices different user requests based on their demands while keeping the probability of false discovery bounded. We demonstrate this idea in the context of HIV treatment research, where multiple researchers conduct tests on a repository of HIV samples."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4663","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4663","fieldValue":"The Quality Preserving Database: A Computational Framework for Encouraging Collaboration, Enhancing Power and Controlling False Discovery"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4663","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4663","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4134","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4664","fieldValue":" This paper presents a novel approach for fast rigid docking of proteins based on geometric complementarity. After extraction of the 3D molecular surface, a set of local surface patches is generated based on the local surface curvature. The shape complementarity between a pair of patches is calculated using an efficient shape descriptor, the Shape Impact Descriptor. The key property of the Shape Impact Descriptor is its rotation invariance, which obviates the need for taking an exhaustive set of rotations for each pair of patches. Thus, complementarity matching between two patches is reduced to a simple histogram matching. Finally, a condensed set of almost complementary pairs of surface patches is supplied as input to the final scoring step, where each pose is evaluated using a 3D distance grid. The experimental results prove that the proposed method demonstrates superior performance over other well-known geometry-based, rigid-docking approaches."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4664","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4664","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4664","fieldValue":"ACM"}
