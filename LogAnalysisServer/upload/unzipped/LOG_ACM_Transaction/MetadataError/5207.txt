{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4208","fieldValue":" A number of different approaches have been proposed to predict elemental component formulas (or molecular formulas) of molecular ions in low and medium resolution mass spectra. Most of them rely on isotope patterns, enumerate all possible formulas for an ion, and exclude certain formulas violating chemical constraints. However, these methods cannot be well generalized to the component prediction of fragment ions in tandem mass spectra. In this paper, a new method, FFP (Fragment ion Formula Prediction), is presented to predict elemental component formulas of fragment ions. In the FFP method, the prediction of the best formulas is converted into the minimization of the distance between theoretical and observed isotope patterns. And, then, a novel local search model is proposed to generate a set of candidate formulas efficiently. After the search, FFP applies a new multiconstraint filtering to exclude as many invalid and improbable formulas as possible. FFP is experimentally compared with the previous enumeration methods, and shown to outperform them significantly. The results of this paper can help to improve the reliability of de novo in the identification of peptide sequences."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4208","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4208","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4208","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4209","fieldValue":" Recent advances in biology (namely, DNA arrays) allow an unprecedented view of the biochemical mechanisms contained within a cell. However, this technology raises new challenges for computer scientists and biologists alike, as the data created by these arrays is often highly complex. One of the challenges is the elucidation of the regulatory connections and interactions between genes, proteins and other gene products. In this paper, a novel method is described for determining gene interactions in temporal gene expression data using genetic algorithms combined with a neural network component. Experiments conducted on real-world temporal gene expression data sets confirm that the approach is capable of finding gene networks that fit the data. A further repeated approach shows that those genes significantly involved in interaction with other genes can be highlighted and hypothetical gene networks and circuits proposed for further laboratory testing."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4209","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4209","fieldValue":"Index Terms- Gene expression analysis, neural networks, genetic algorithms, reverse-engineering, gene interactions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4209","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4209","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4210","fieldValue":" Selection of machine learning techniques requires a certain sensitivity to the requirements of the problem. In particular, the problem can be made more tractable by deliberately using algorithms that are biased toward solutions of the requisite kind. In this paper, we argue that recurrent neural networks have a natural bias toward a problem domain of which biological sequence analysis tasks are a subset. We use experiments with synthetic data to illustrate this bias. We then demonstrate that this bias can be exploitable using a data set of protein sequences containing several classes of subcellular localization targeting peptides. The results show that, compared with feed forward, recurrent neural networks will generally perform better on sequence analysis tasks. Furthermore, as the patterns within the sequence become more ambiguous, the choice of specific recurrent architecture becomes more critical."}
