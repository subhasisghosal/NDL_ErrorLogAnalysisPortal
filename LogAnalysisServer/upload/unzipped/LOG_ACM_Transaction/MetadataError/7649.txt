In this paper, we design a custom cross-layer framework that enables: 1) implementation of multiple and previously unimplemented rate adaptation mechanisms; 2) experimental evaluation and comparison of rate adaptation protocols on controlled, repeatable channels as well as residential urban and downtown vehicular and nonmobile environments in which we accurately measure channel conditions with 100-µs granularity; and 3) comparison of performance on a per-packet basis with the ideal modulation rate obtained via exhaustive experimental search. Our evaluation reveals that SNR-triggered protocols are susceptible to overselection from the ideal rate when the coherence time is low (a scenario that we show occurs in practice even in a nonmobile topology), and that \"in situ\" training can produce large gains to overcome this sensitivity. Another key finding is that a mechanism effective in differentiating between collision and fading losses for hidden terminals has severely imbalanced throughput sharing when competing links are even slightly heterogeneous. In general, we find trained SNR-based protocols outperform loss-based protocols in terms of the ability to track vehicular clients, accuracy within outdoor environments, and balanced sharing with heterogeneous links (even with physical layer capture)."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10108","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10108","fieldValue":"Modulation rate adaptation in urban and vehicular environments: cross-layer implementation and experimental evaluation"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10108","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10108","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10109","fieldValue":" In this paper, we study asymmetric power assignments that induce a low-energy k-strongly connected communication graph with spanner properties. We address two spanner models: energy and distance. The former serves as an indicator for the energy consumed in a message propagation between two nodes, while the latter reflects the geographic properties of routing in the induced communication graph. We consider a random wireless ad hoc network with |V| = n nodes distributed uniformly and independently in a unit square. For k ∈ {1,2}, we propose several power assignments that obtain a good bicriteria approximation on the total cost and stretch factor under the two models. For k > 2, we analyze a power assignment developed by Carmi et al. and derive some interesting bounds on the stretch factor for both models as well. We also describe how to compute all the power assignments distributively, and we provide simulation results. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first provable theoretical bounds for low-cost spanners in wireless ad hoc networks."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10109","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10109","fieldValue":"ACM"}
