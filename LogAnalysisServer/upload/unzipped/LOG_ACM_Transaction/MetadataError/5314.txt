Though motivated by biological rather than mathematical considerations, this parameter turns out to be closely related to the bandwidth parameter of a graph. Our focus will be on how this parameter affects the characteristics of clusters: how numerous they are, how large they are, how rearranged they are, and to what extent they are preserved from ancestor to descendant in a phylogenetic tree. We infer the latter property by dynamic programming optimization of the presence of individual edges at the ancestral nodes of the phylogeny. We apply our analysis to a set of genomes drawn from the Yeast Gene Order Browser."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4417","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4417","fieldValue":"Comparative genomics, gene clusters, yeast, evolution, phylogeny, genome rearrangements, graph bandwidth, dynamic programming, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida glabrata, Ashbya gossypii, Kluyveromyces waltii, Kluyveromyces lactis."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4417","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4417","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4418","fieldValue":" The gene-duplication problem is to infer a species supertree from a collection of gene trees that are confounded by complex histories of gene-duplication events. This problem is NP-complete and thus requires efficient and effective heuristics. Existing heuristics perform a stepwise search of the tree space, where each step is guided by an exact solution to an instance of a local search problem. A classical local search problem is the {\\tt NNI} search problem, which is based on the nearest neighbor interchange operation. In this work, we 1) provide a novel near-linear time algorithm for the {\\tt NNI} search problem, 2) introduce extensions that significantly enlarge the search space of the {\\tt NNI} search problem, and 3) present algorithms for these extended versions that are asymptotically just as efficient as our algorithm for the {\\tt NNI} search problem. The exceptional speedup achieved in the extended {\\tt NNI} search problems makes the gene-duplication problem more tractable for large-scale phylogenetic analyses. We verify the performance of our algorithms in a comparison study using sets of large randomly generated gene trees."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4418","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4418","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4418","fieldValue":"ACM"}
