As such, techniques that enhance the reliability of sensor communications in the presence of radio interference are critical. In this article, we propose to cope with this threat through a technique called channel surfing, whereby the sensor nodes in the network adapt their channel assignments to restore network connectivity in the presence of interference. We explore two different approaches to channel surfing: coordinated channel switching, in which the entire sensor network adjusts its channel; and spectral multiplexing, in which nodes in a jammed region switch channels and nodes on the boundary of a jammed region act as radio relays between different spectral zones. For coordinated channel switching, we examine an autonomous strategy where each node detects the loss of its neighbors in order to initiate channel switching. To cope with latency issues in the autonomous strategy, we propose a broadcast-assisted channel switching strategy to more rapidly coordinate channel switching. For spectral multiplexing, we have devised both synchronous and asynchronous strategies to facilitate the scheduling of nodes in order to improve network fidelity when sensor nodes operate on multiple channels. In designing these algorithms, we have taken a system-oriented approach that has focused on exploring actual implementation issues under realistic network settings. We have implemented these proposed methods on a testbed of 30 Mica2 sensor nodes, and the experimental results show that channel surfing, in its various forms, is an effective technique for repairing network connectivity in the presence of radio interference, while not introducing significant performance-overhead."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21244","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21244","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21245","fieldValue":"Li, Ze-Nian"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21245","fieldValue":" A major issue of activity recognition in sensor networks is automatically recognizing a user's high-level goals accurately from low-level sensor data. Traditionally, solutions to this problem involve the use of a location-based sensor model that predicts the physical locations of a user from the sensor data. This sensor model is often trained offline, incurring a large amount of calibration effort. In this article, we address the problem using a goal-based segmentation approach, in which we automatically segment the low-level user traces that are obtained cheaply by collecting the signal sequences as a user moves in wireless environments. From the traces we discover primitive signal segments that can be used for building a probabilistic activity model to recognize goals directly. A major advantage of our algorithm is that it can reduce a significant amount of human effort in calibrating the sensor data while still achieving comparable recognition accuracy. We present our theoretical framework for activity recognition, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our new approach using the data collected in an indoor wireless environment."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21245","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21245","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21246","fieldValue":" Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are increasingly being used to monitor various parameters in a wide range of environmental monitoring applications. In many instances, environmental scientists are interested in collecting raw data using long-running queries injected into a WSN for analyzing at a later stage, rather than injecting snap-shot queries containing data-reducing operators (e.g., MIN, MAX, AVG) that aggregate data. Collection of raw data poses a challenge to WSNs as very large amounts of data need to be transported through the network. This not only leads to high levels of energy consumption and thus diminished network lifetime but also results in poor data quality as much of the data may be lost due to the limited bandwidth of present-day sensor nodes. We alleviate this problem by allowing certain nodes in the network to aggregate data by taking advantage of spatial and temporal correlations of various physical parameters and thus eliminating the transmission of redundant data. In this article we present a distributed scheduling algorithm that decides when a particular node should perform this novel type of aggregation. The scheduling algorithm autonomously reassigns schedules when changes in network topology, due to failing or newly added nodes, are detected. Such changes in topology are detected using cross-layer information from the underlying MAC layer. We first present the theoretical performance bounds of our algorithm. We then present simulation results, which indicate a reduction in message transmissions of up to 85&percnt; and an increase in network lifetime of up to 92&percnt; when compared to collecting raw data. Our algorithm is also capable of completely eliminating dropped messages caused by buffer overflow."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21246","fieldValue":"A distributed and self-organizing scheduling algorithm for energy-efficient data aggregation in wireless sensor networks"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21246","fieldValue":"ACM"}
