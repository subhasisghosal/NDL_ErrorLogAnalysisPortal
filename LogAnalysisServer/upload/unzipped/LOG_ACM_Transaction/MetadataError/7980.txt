The number of layers received (and thus the receive rate) determines the quality of the decoded video stream. For such layered multicast streaming, network coding provides higher capacity than multicast routing. Network coding can be performed within a layer or across layers, and in general, interlayer coding outperforms intralayer coding. An optimal solution to a network-coded layered multicast problem may require decoding of the network code at interior nodes to extract information to be forwarded. However, decoding consumes resources and introduces delay, which is particularly undesirable at interior nodes (the routers) of the network. In this paper, we thus focus on the interlayer network coding problem without decoding at interior nodes. We show that the problem is NP-hard and propose a heuristic algorithm for rate allocation and coding based on the Edmonds--Karp maximum flow algorithm. We prove that our algorithm ensures decodability of the information received and provides some fairness properties. Finally, we perform extensive simulations and show that our algorithm may even outperform other heuristics that do require decoding at interior nodes."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10779","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10779","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10779","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10780","fieldValue":" The use of wirelessly internetworked miniaturized biomedical devices is promising a significant leap forward in medical treatment of many pervasive diseases. Recognizing the limitations of traditional radio-frequency wireless communications in interconnecting devices within the human body, in this paper, we propose for the first time to develop network protocols for implantable devices based on ultrasonic transmissions. We start off by assessing the theoretical feasibility of using ultrasonic waves in human tissues and by deriving an accurate channel model for ultrasonic intrabody communications. Then, we propose a new ultrasonic transmission and multiple access technique, which we refer to as Ultrasonic WideBand (UsWB). UsWB is based on the idea of transmitting information bits spread over very short pulses following a time-hopping pattern. The short impulse duration results in limited reflection and scattering effects, and the low duty cycle reduces the impact of thermal and mechanical effects, which may be detrimental for human health. We then develop a multiple access technique with distributed control to enable efficient simultaneous access by mutually interfering devices based on minimal and localized information exchange and on measurements at the receiver only. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of UsWB through a multiscale simulator that models the proposed communication system at the acoustic wave level, at the physical (bit) level, and at the network (packet) level. We also validate the simulation results by comparing them to experimental results obtained with a software-defined testbed."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10780","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10780","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10780","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10781","fieldValue":"Li, Yu-Sian"}
