This study extends the same methodology to three-dimensional simulation of the acoustic response of graphical models of the vocal tract obtained from magnetic resonance imaging for a group of trained subjects. By such simulation of the vocal tract transfer function and convolution with an appropriate source waveform, basic phonemes are resynthesized and compared with benchmark audio recordings. The technologies and techniques used for simulation are described, alongside the protocol for image capture and the process for collection of benchmark audio. The results of simulation and acoustic recording are then evaluated and compared. The value of three-dimensional simulation in comparison to existing lower-dimensionality equivalents is assessed. It is found that while three-dimensional simulation provides a strong representation of the low frequency vocal tract transfer function, at higher frequencies its performance becomes geometry-dependent. MRI imaging and benchmark audio is provided for future studies and to permit comparison with comparable means of acoustic simulation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3621","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3621","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3622","fieldValue":" Acoustic intensity is a vectorial measure of acoustic energy flow through a given region of interest. Three-dimensional measurement of acoustic intensity requires special microphone array configurations. This paper provides a theoretical analysis of open spherical microphone arrays for the 3-D measurement of acoustic intensity. The calculations of the pressure and the particle velocity components of the sound field inside a closed volume are expressed using the Kirchhoff-Helmholtz integral equation. The conditions which simplify the calculation are identified. This calculation is then constrained to a finite set of microphones positioned at prescribed points on an open sphere. Several open spherical array topologies are proposed. Their magnitude and directional errors and measurement bandwidths are investigated via numerical simulations. A comparison with conventional open-sphere 3-D intensity probes is presented."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3622","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3622","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3623","fieldValue":"Taemin Cho"}
