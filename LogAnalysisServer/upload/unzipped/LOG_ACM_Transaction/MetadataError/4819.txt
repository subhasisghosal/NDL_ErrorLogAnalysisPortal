To develop such clients, we present a parameterized network traffic model, based on a large collection of Second Life traces gathered by us. Our methodology is also applicable to virtual worlds other than Second Life. With the traffic model, various optimization criteria can be adopted, including visual quality, response time, and energy consumption. We use energy consumption as the show case, and demonstrate via trace-driven simulations that, compared to two existing schemes, a mobile client can save up to 36&percnt; and 41&percnt; communication energy by selectively turning on its WiFi network interface."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25488","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25488","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25489","fieldValue":" This article presents a novel content-based copy detection system for 3D videos. The system creates compact and robust depth and visual signatures from the 3D videos. Then, signature of a query video is compared against an indexed database of reference videos' signatures. The system returns a score, using both spatial and temporal characteristics of videos, indicating whether the query video matches any video in the reference video database, and in case of matching, which portion of the reference video matches the query video. Analysis shows that the system is efficient, both computationally and storage-wise. The system can be used, for example, by video content owners, video hosting sites, and third-party companies to find illegally copied 3D videos. We implemented Spider, a complete realization of the proposed system, and conducted rigorous experiments on it. Our experimental results show that the proposed system can achieve high accuracy in terms of precision and recall even if the 3D videos are subjected to several transformations at the same time. For example, the proposed system yields 100&percnt; precision and recall when copied videos are parts of original videos, and more than 90&percnt; precision and recall when copied videos are subjected to different individual transformations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25489","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25489","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25490","fieldValue":" A global network of webcams offers unique viewpoints from tens of thousands of locations. Understanding the geographic context of this imagery is vital in using these cameras for quantitative environmental monitoring or surveillance applications. We derive robust geo-calibration constraints that allow users to geo-register static or pan-tilt-zoom cameras by specifying a few corresponding points, and describe our Web interface suitable for novices. We discuss design decisions that support our scalable, publicly accessible Web service that allows webcam textures to be displayed live on 3D geographic models. Finally, we demonstrate several multimedia applications for geo-calibrated cameras."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25490","fieldValue":"ACM"}
