This system performs gesture recognition in real time by combining imagery from multiple cameras without using a central server. We propose a system architecture that uses a network of inexpensive cameras to perform in-network video processing. A methodology for transforming well-designed single-node algorithm to distributed system is also proposed. Applications for ubiquitous cameras can be modeled as the composition of a finite-state machine of the system, functional services, and middleware. A service-oriented software architecture is proposed to dynamically reconfigure services when system state changes. By exchanging data and control messages between neighboring sensors, each node can maintain broader view of the environment with integrated video-processing results. Our prototype system is built on Windows machines, and uses standard video cameras as sensors and local network as a communication channel."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6454","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6454","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1593","fieldValue":" To better address power concerns, a good design strategy should be flexible enough to dynamically reconfigure available resources according to the application's needs such that extra power is dissipated only when it is really needed. In this work, we focus on power-aware solutions for the issue queue (IQ) in an out-of-order superscalar processor. We propose two schemes that partition the IQ into FIFOs such that only the instructions at the head of each FIFO may request to issue. We then monitor the processor and dynamically vary the number and\/or size of FIFOs in accordance with utilization. Experimenting with two different distributions in power dissipation, we show up to 69&percnt; reduction in power dissipation in the wakeup and arbitration loop, while constraining performance degradation to be no more than 5&percnt;."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1593","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1593","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6455","fieldValue":"Stankovic, John A"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6455","fieldValue":"Abdelzaher, Tarek F"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6455","fieldValue":" Multifrequency media access control has been well understood in general wireless ad hoc networks, while in wireless sensor networks, researchers still focus on single frequency solutions. In wireless sensor networks, each device is typically equipped with a single radio transceiver and applications adopt much smaller packet sizes compared to those in general wireless ad hoc networks. Hence, the multifrequency MAC protocols proposed for general wireless ad hoc networks are not suitable for wireless sensor network applications, which we further demonstrate through our simulation experiments. In this article, we propose MMSN, which takes advantage of multifrequency availability while, at the same time, takes into consideration the restrictions of wireless sensor networks. In MMSN, four frequency assignment options are provided to meet different application requirements. A scalable media access is designed with efficient broadcast support. Also, an optimal nonuniform back-off algorithm is derived and its lightweight approximation is implemented in MMSN, which significantly reduces congestion in the time synchronized media access design. Through extensive experiments, MMSN exhibits the prominent ability to utilize parallel transmissions among neighboring nodes. When multiple physical frequencies are available, it also achieves increased energy efficiency, demonstrating the ability to work against radio interference and the tolerance to a wide range of measured time synchronization errors."}
