A restoration scheme dynamically discovers alternate paths bypassing the failed component. This paper presents an (online) improved quasi-path restoration (IQPR) scheme. IQPR is derived from the two-commodity max-flow algorithm. The running time complexity of IQPR is $O(|V|^3$). Therefore, IQPR is computationally more efficient and more scalable than path restoration (PR). IQPR is faster (in restoration speed) and less complex than PR, and more economical (in spare capacity requirement) than link restoration (LR). Thus, it provides a good alternative to PR when quick restoration of disrupted traffic is desired. The (offline) spare capacity planning problem deals with the allocation of spare capacity to each link in the network, such that the spare capacity requirement is minimized, while guaranteeing the desired level of restoration in the event of a link failure. The spare capacity allocation problems for LR, original quasi-path restoration (OQPR), IQPR, link-disjoint path restoration (LDPR) and PR are formulated as integer linear programming problems. Numerical results illustrate that the restoration schemes studied can be sorted from the least efficient to the most efficient (in the spare capacity requirement) in the following order: LR, OQPR, IQPR, LDPR and PR. The experimental analysis shows that network topology and demand patterns have a significant impact on the spare capacity savings offered by one scheme over the other. Merits and demerits of these schemes are also discussed."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9708","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9708","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9708","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9709","fieldValue":" Networks employ link protection to achieve fast recovery from link failures. While the first link failure can be protected using link protection, there are several alternatives for protecting against the second failure. This paper formally classifies the approaches to dual-link failure resiliency. One of the strategies to recover from dual-link failures is to employ link protection for the two failed links independently, which requires that two links may not use each other in their backup paths if they may fail simultaneously. Such a requirement is referred to as backup link mutual exclusion (BLME) constraint and the problem of identifying a backup path for every link that satisfies the above requirement is referred to as the BLME problem. This paper develops the necessary theory to establish the sufficient conditions for existence of a solution to the BLME problem. Solution methodologies for the BLME problem is developed using two approaches by: 1) formulating the backup path selection as an integer linear program; 2) developing a polynomial time heuristic based on minimum cost path routing. The ILP formulation and heuristic are applied to six networks and their performance is compared with approaches that assume precise knowledge of dual-link failure. It is observed that a solution exists for all of the six networks considered. The heuristic approach is shown to obtain feasible solutions that are resilient to most dual-link failures, although the backup path lengths may be significantly higher than optimal. In addition, the paper illustrates the significance of the knowledge of failure location by illustrating that network with higher connectivity may require lesser capacity than one with a lower connectivity to recover from dual-link failures."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9709","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9709","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9709","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/1878","fieldValue":"Breughe, Maximilien B"}
