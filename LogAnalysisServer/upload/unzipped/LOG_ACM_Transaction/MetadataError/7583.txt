{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9975","fieldValue":" In this paper, we are interested in minimizing the delay and maximizing the lifetime of event-driven wireless sensor networks for which events occur infrequently. In such systems, most of the energy is consumed when the radios are on, waiting for a packet to arrive. Sleep-wake scheduling is an effective mechanism to prolong the lifetime of these energy-constrained wireless sensor networks. However, sleep-wake scheduling could result in substantial delays because a transmitting node needs to wait for its next-hop relay node to wake up. An interesting line of work attempts to reduce these delays by developing \"anycast\"-based packet forwarding schemes, where each node opportunistically forwards a packet to the first neighboring node that wakes up among multiple candidate nodes. In this paper, we first study how to optimize the anycast forwarding schemes for minimizing the expected packet-delivery delays from the sensor nodes to the sink. Based on this result, we then provide a solution to the joint control problem of how to optimally control the system parameters of the sleep-wake scheduling protocol and the anycast packet-forwarding protocol to maximize the network lifetime, subject to a constraint on the expected end-to-end packet-delivery delay. Our numerical results indicate that the proposed solution can outperform prior heuristic solutions in the literature, especially under practical scenarios where there are obstructions, e.g., a lake or a mountain, in the coverage area of the wireless sensor network."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9975","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9975","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9975","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9976","fieldValue":" A new rearrangeable nonblocking photonic multi-log2 N network DM(N) is introduced. It is shown that DM(N) network possesses many good properties simultaneously. These good properties include all those of existing rearrangeable nonblocking photonic multi-log2 N networks and new ones such as O(log N)-time fast parallel self-routing, nonblocking multiple-multicast, and cost-effective crosstalk-free wavelength dilation, which existing rearrangeable nonblocking multi-log2 N networks do not have. The advantages of DM(N) over existing multi-log2 N networks, especially Log2(N, 0, $2^‚åälog2 N\/2‚å\u2039), are achieved by employing a two-level load balancing scheme--a combination of static load balancing and dynamic load balancing. DM(N) and Log2(N, 0, 2‚åälog2 N\/2‚å\u2039$) are about the same in structure. The additional cost is for the intraplane routing preprocessing circuits. Considering the extended capabilities of DM(N) and current mature and cheap electronic technology, this extra cost is well justified."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9976","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9976","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9976","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9977","fieldValue":" Analytical modeling of the 802.11e enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) mechanism is today a fairly mature research area, considering the very large number of papers that have appeared in the literature. However, most work in this area models the EDCA operation through per-slot statistics, namely probability of transmission and collisions referred to \"slots.\" In so doing, they still share a methodology originally proposed for the 802.11 Distributed Coordination Function (DCF), although they do extend it by considering differentiated transmission\/ collision probabilities over different slots.We aim to show that it is possible to devise 802.11e models that do not rely on per-slot statistics. To this purpose, we introduce and describe a novel modeling methodology that does not use per-slot transmission\/collision probabilities, but relies on the fixed-point computation of the whole (residual) backoff counter distribution occurring after a generic transmission attempt. The proposed approach achieves high accuracy in describing the channel access operations, not only in terms of throughput and delay performance, but also in terms of low-level performance metrics."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9977","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
