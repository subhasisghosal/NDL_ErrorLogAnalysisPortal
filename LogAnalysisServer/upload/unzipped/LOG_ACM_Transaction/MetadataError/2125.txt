However, constructing either fully automatically or with limited user control a low-distortion polycube from a detailed surface remains challenging in practice. We propose a variational method for deforming an input triangle mesh into a polycube shape through minimization of the $&ell;_1$-norm of the mesh normals, regularized via an as-rigid-as-possible volumetric distortion energy. Unlike previous work, our approach makes no assumption on the orientation, or on the presence of features in the input model. User-guided control over the resulting polycube map is also offered to increase design flexibility. We demonstrate the robustness, efficiency, and controllability of our method on a variety of examples, and explore applications in hexahedral remeshing and quadrangulation."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/17166","fieldValue":"&ell;<sub>1<\/sub> optimization"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17166","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17166","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17167","fieldValue":"Jacobs, David W"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17167","fieldValue":" We consider the problem of finding a geometrically consistent set of point matches between two images. We assume that local descriptors have provided a set of candidate matches, which may include many outliers. We then seek the largest subset of these correspondences that can be aligned perfectly using a nonrigid deformation that exerts a bounded distortion. We formulate this as a constrained optimization problem and solve it using a constrained, iterative reweighted least-squares algorithm. In each iteration of this algorithm we solve a convex quadratic program obtaining a globally optimal match over a subset of the bounded distortion transformations. We further prove that a sequence of such iterations converges monotonically to a critical point of our objective function. We show experimentally that this algorithm produces excellent results on a number of test sets, in comparison to several state-of-the-art approaches."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17167","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17167","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17168","fieldValue":"Bargteil, Adam W"}
