The flexibility of the on-chip clock generation capability found in modern FPGAs is employed to step through a range of frequencies until timing failure in the combinatorial circuit is detected. In this way, the delay of any combinatorial circuit can be determined with a timing resolution of the order of picoseconds. Parallel and optimized implementations of the method for self-characterization of the delay of all the LUTs on an FPGA are also proposed. The method was applied to Altera Cyclone II and III FPGAs . A complete self-characterization of LUTs on a Cyclone II was achieved in 2.5 seconds, utilizing only 13kbit of block RAM to store the results. More extensive tests were carried out on the Cyclone III and the delays of adder circuits and embedded multiplier blocks were successfully measured. This self-measurement method paves the way for matching timing requirements in designs to FPGAs as a means of combating the problem of process variations."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21720","fieldValue":"FPGA"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21720","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21720","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21721","fieldValue":" Operating frequencies of combinational logic circuits can be increased using Wave-Pipelining (WP), by adjusting the clock periods and clock skews. In this article, Built-In Self-Test (BIST) and System-on-Chip (SOC) approaches are proposed for automating this adjustment and they are evaluated by implementation of filters using a Distributed Arithmetic Algorithm (DAA) and sinewave generator using the COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer (CORDIC). Both the circuits are studied by adopting three schemes: wave-pipelining, pipelining, and nonpipelining. Xilinx Spartan II and Altera Cyclone II FPGAs with Nios II soft-core processor are used for implementation of the circuits with the BIST and SOC approaches, respectively. The proposed schemes increase the speed of the WP circuits by a factor of 1.19--2.6 compared to nonpipelined circuits. The pipelined circuits achieve higher speed than the WP circuits by a factor of 1.13--3.27 at the cost of increase in area and power. When both pipelined and WP circuits are operated at the same frequency, the former dissipates more power for circuits with higher word sizes and for moderate logic depths. The observation regarding the dependence of the superiority of the WP circuits with regard to power dissipation on the logic depth is one of the major contributions of this article."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21721","fieldValue":"CORDIC"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21721","fieldValue":"DAA"}
