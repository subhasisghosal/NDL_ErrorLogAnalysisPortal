Inferring the gene order of an extinct species has a wide range of applications, including the potential to reveal more detailed evolutionary histories, to determine gene content and ordering, and to understand the consequences of structural changes for organismal function and species divergence. In this study, we propose a new adjacency-based method, PMAG+, to infer ancestral genomes under a more general model of gene evolution involving gene insertions and deletions (indels), in addition to gene rearrangements. PMAG+ improves on our previous method PMAG by developing a new approach to infer ancestral gene contents and reducing the adjacency assembly problem to an instance of TSP. We designed a series of experiments to extensively validate PMAG+ and compared the results with the most recent and comparable method GapAdj. According to the results, ancestral gene contents predicted by PMAG+ coincides highly with the actual contents with error rates less than 1 percent. Under various degrees of indels, PMAG+ consistently achieves more accurate prediction of ancestral gene orders and at the same time, produces contigs very close to the actual chromosomes."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5076","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5076","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5076","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5077","fieldValue":"De Moor, Bart"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5077","fieldValue":" We propose a method, maximum likelihood estimation of generalized eigenvalue decomposition (MLGEVD) that employs a well known technique relying on the generalization of singular value decomposition (SVD). The main aim of the work is to show the tight equivalence between MLGEVD and generalized ridge regression. This relationship reveals an important mathematical property of GEVD in which the second argument act as prior information in the model. Thus we show that MLGEVD allows the incorporation of external knowledge about the quantities of interest into the estimation problem. We illustrate the importance of prior knowledge in clinical decision making\/identifying differentially expressed genes with case studies for which microarray data sets with corresponding clinical\/literature information are available. On all of these three case studies, MLGEVD outperformed GEVD on prediction in terms of test area under the ROC curve (test AUC). MLGEVD results in significantly improved diagnosis, prognosis and prediction of therapy response."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5077","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5077","fieldValue":"ACM"}
