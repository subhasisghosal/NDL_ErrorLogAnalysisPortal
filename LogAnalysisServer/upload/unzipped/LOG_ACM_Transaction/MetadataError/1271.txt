Then the effects of a projective transformation of the parameter space are described in terms of a group representation. This representation is used to answer the following questions: (1) If the control points are held fixed, when do two different sets of weights determine the same rational curve? (2) How do we find the control points for a subdivision of the original curve?"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14962","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14962","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14963","fieldValue":" An algorithm is presented for ray tracing generalized cylinders, that is, objects defined by sweeping a two-dimensional contour along a three-dimensional trajectory. The contour can be any 'well-behaved' curve in the sense that it is continuous, and that the points where the tangent is horizontal or vertical can be determined, the trajectory can be any spline curve. First a definition is given of generalized cylinders in terms of the Frenet frame of the trajectory. Then the main problem in ray tracing these objects, the computation of the intersection points with a ray, is reduced to the problem of intersecting two two-dimensional curves. This problem is solved by a subdivision algorithm. The three-dimensional normal at the intersection point closest to the eye point, necessary to perform shading, is obtained by transforming the two-dimensional normal at the corresponding intersection point of the two two-dimensional curves. In this way it is possible to obtain highly realistic images for a very broad class of objects."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14963","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14963","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14964","fieldValue":" An overview of the X Window System is presented, focusing on the system substrate and the low-level facilities provided to build applications and to manage the desktop. The system provides high-performance, high-level, device-independent graphics. A hierarchy of resizable, overlapping windows allows a wide variety of application and user interfaces to be built easily. Network-transparent access to the display provides an important degree of functional separation, without significantly affecting performance, which is crucial to building applications for a distributed environment. To a reasonable extent, desktop management can be custom-tailored to individual environments, without modifying the base system and typically without affecting applications."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14964","fieldValue":"ACM"}
