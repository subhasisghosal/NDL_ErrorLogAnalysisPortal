{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10636","fieldValue":" Current Gigabit-class passive optical networks (PONs) evolve into next-generation PONs, whereby high-speed Gb\/s time division multiplexing (TDM) and long-reach wavelength-broadcasting\/routing wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) PONs are promising near-term candidates. On the other hand, next-generation wireless local area networks (WLANs) based on frame aggregation techniques will leverage physical-layer enhancements, giving rise to Gigabit-class very high throughput (VHT) WLANs. In this paper, we develop an analytical framework for evaluating the capacity and delay performance of a wide range of routing algorithms in converged fiber-wireless (FiWi) broadband access networks based on different next-generation PONs and a Gigabit-class multiradio multichannel WLAN-mesh front end. Our framework is very flexible and incorporates arbitrary frame size distributions, traffic matrices, optical\/wireless propagation delays, data rates, and fiber faults. We verify the accuracy of our probabilistic analysis by means of simulation for the wireless and wireless-optical-wireless operation modes of various FiWi network architectures under peer-to-peer, upstream, uniform, and nonuniform traffic scenarios. The results indicate that our proposed optimized FiWi routing algorithm (OFRA) outperforms minimum (wireless) hop and delay routing in terms of throughput for balanced and unbalanced traffic loads, at the expense of a slightly increased mean delay at small to medium traffic loads."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10636","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10636","fieldValue":"FiWi access networks based on next-generation PON and gigabit-class WLAN technologies: a capacity and delay analysis"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10636","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10636","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10637","fieldValue":"Sheng, Shang-Pin"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10637","fieldValue":" In this paper, we formulate a contract design problem where a primary license holder wishes to profit from its excess spectrum capacity by selling it to potential secondary users\/buyers. It needs to determine how to optimally price the excess spectrum so as to maximize its profit, knowing that this excess capacity is stochastic in nature, does not come with exclusive access, and cannot provide deterministic service guarantees to a buyer. At the same time, buyers are of different types, characterized by different communication needs, tolerance for the channel uncertainty, and so on, all of which are a buyer's private information. The license holder must then try to design different contracts catered to different types of buyers in order to maximize its profit. We address this problem by adopting as a reference a traditional spectrum market where the buyer can purchase exclusive access with fixed\/deterministic guarantees. We fully characterize the optimal solution in the cases where there is a single buyer type, and when multiple types of buyers share the same known channel condition as a result of the primary user activity. In the most general case, we construct an algorithm that generates a set of contracts in a computationally efficient manner and show that this set is optimal when the buyer types satisfy a monotonicity condition."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10637","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10637","fieldValue":"Profit incentive in trading nonexclusive access on a secondary spectrum market through contract design"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10637","fieldValue":"ACM"}
