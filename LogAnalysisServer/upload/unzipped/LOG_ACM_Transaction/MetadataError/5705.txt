{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5126","fieldValue":" Proteins fold into complex three-dimensional shapes. Simplified representations of their shapes are central to rationalise, compare, classify, and interpret protein structures. Traditional methods to abstract protein folding patterns rely on representing their standard secondary structural elements (helices and strands of sheet) using line segments. This results in ignoring a significant proportion of structural information. The motivation of this research is to derive mathematically rigorous and biologically meaningful abstractions of protein folding patterns that maximize the economy of structural description and minimize the loss of structural information. We report on a novel method to describe a protein as a non-overlapping set of parametric three dimensional curves of varying length and complexity. Our approach to this problem is supported by information theory and uses the statistical framework of minimum message length (MML) inference. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our non-linear abstraction to support efficient and effective comparison of protein folding patterns on a large scale."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5126","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5126","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5126","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5127","fieldValue":" Analysis of probability distributions conditional on species trees has demonstrated the existence of anomalous ranked gene trees (ARGTs), ranked gene trees that are more probable than the ranked gene tree that accords with the ranked species tree. Here, to improve the characterization of ARGTs, we study enumerative and probabilistic properties of two classes of ranked labeled species trees, focusing on the presence or avoidance of certain subtree patterns associated with the production of ARGTs. We provide exact enumerations and asymptotic estimates for cardinalities of these sets of trees, showing that as the number of species increases without bound, the fraction of all ranked labeled species trees that are ARGT-producing approaches 1. This result extends beyond earlier existence results to provide a probabilistic claim about the frequency of ARGTs."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5127","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5127","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5127","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5128","fieldValue":" The existence of various types of correlations among the expressions of a group of biologically significant genes poses challenges in developing effective methods of gene expression data analysis. The initial focus of computational biologists was to work with only absolute and shifting correlations. However, researchers have found that the ability to handle shifting-and-scaling correlation enables them to extract more biologically relevant and interesting patterns from gene microarray data. In this paper, we introduce an effective shifting-and-scaling correlation measure named Shifting and Scaling Similarity (SSSim), which can detect highly correlated gene pairs in any gene expression data. We also introduce a technique named Intensive Correlation Search (ICS) biclustering algorithm, which uses SSSim to extract biologically significant biclusters from a gene expression data set. The technique performs satisfactorily with a number of benchmarked gene expression data sets when evaluated in terms of functional categories in Gene Ontology database."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5128","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
