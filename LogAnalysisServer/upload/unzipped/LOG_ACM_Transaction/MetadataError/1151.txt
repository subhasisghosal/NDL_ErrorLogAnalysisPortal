We present a novel approach to this problem, in which the relationship between the application data and the persistent storage is specified using a declarative mapping, which is compiled into bidirectional views that drive the data transformation engine. Expressing the application model as a view on the database is used to answer queries, while expressing the database schema as a view on the application model allows us to leverage view maintenance algorithms for update translation. This approach has been implemented in a commercial product. It enables developers to interact with a relational database via a conceptual schema and an object-oriented programming surface. We outline the implemented system and focus on the challenges of mapping compilation, which include rewriting queries under constraints and supporting nonrelational constructs."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14462","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14462","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2374","fieldValue":" We provide efficient constant-factor approximation algorithms for the problems of finding a hierarchical clustering of a point set in any metric space, minimizing the sum of minimimum spanning tree lengths within each cluster, and in the hyperbolic or Euclidean planes, minimizing the sum of cluster perimeters. Our algorithms for the hyperbolic and Euclidean planes can also be used to provide a pants decomposition, that is, a set of disjoint simple closed curves partitioning the plane minus the input points into subsets with exactly three boundary components, with approximately minimum total length. In the Euclidean case, these curves are squares; in the hyperbolic case, they combine our Euclidean square pants decomposition with our tree clustering method for general metric spaces."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2374","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2374","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14463","fieldValue":" This article describes query processing in the DBO database system. Like other database systems designed for ad hoc analytic processing, DBO is able to compute the exact answers to queries over a large relational database in a scalable fashion. Unlike any other system designed for analytic processing, DBO can constantly maintain a guess as to the final answer to an aggregate query throughout execution, along with statistically meaningful bounds for the guess's accuracy. As DBO gathers more and more information, the guess gets more and more accurate, until it is 100&percnt; accurate as the query is completed. This allows users to stop the execution as soon as they are happy with the query accuracy, and thus encourages exploratory data analysis."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14463","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14463","fieldValue":"ACM"}
