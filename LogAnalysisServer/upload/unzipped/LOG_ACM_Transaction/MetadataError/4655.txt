A realistic pedestrian simulation requires a realistic pedestrian behavioral model that takes into account the various behavioral aspects of a real pedestrian. In this article, we describe our work on such a model, which aims to generate human-like pedestrian behaviors. To this end, various important factors in a real-pedestrian's decision-making process are considered in our model. These factors include a pedestrian's sensory attention, memory, and navigational behaviors. In particular, a two-level navigation model is proposed to generate realistic navigational behavior. As a result, our pedestrian model is able to generate various realistic behaviors such as overtaking, waiting, side-stepping and lane-forming in a crowded area. The simulated pedestrians are also able to navigate through complex environment, given an abstract map of the environment."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25031","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25031","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25032","fieldValue":" Motivated by excessively high benchmarking efforts caused by a rapidly expanding design space, increasing system complexity, and prevailing practices based on ad-hoc and subjective schemes, this article seeks to enhance architecture exploration and evaluation efficiency by strategically integrating a genetic algorithm, 3-D geometrical rendering, and multivariate statistical analysis into one unified methodology frameworkâ\u20AC\u201DSubsetTrioâ\u20AC\u201Dcapable of subsetting any given benchmark suite based on its inherent workload characteristics, desired workload space coverage, and the total execution time intended by the user. By encoding both representativity (i.e., workload space coverage represented by the volume of the convex hull of benchmarks) and efficiency (i.e., total run time) as a co-optimization objective of a survival-of-the-fittest evolutionary algorithm, we can systematically determine a globally â\u20ACœfittestâ\u20AC? (i.e., most representative and efficient) benchmark subset according to the workload space coverage threshold specified by the user. We demonstrate the usage, efficacy, and efficiency of the proposed technique by conducting a thorough case study on the SPEC benchmark suite, and evaluate its validity based on 50 commercial computer systems. Compared to the state-of-the-art statistical subsetting approach based on the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), SubsetTrio could select a significantly more time-efficient subset, while covering the same or higher workload space."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25032","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25032","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25033","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25033","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25034","fieldValue":" The British National Health Service (NHS) has a performance management framework that aims to guarantee short waiting times for patients by including mandatory targets for hospitals. DGHPSim is a suite of four components that simulates the activities of an NHS general hospital to show the effect of different policies on waiting times in these hospitals. DGHPSim has a generic structure that is used to simulate a particular hospital by employing data appropriate to that hospital from available data sets. Two of the components of DGHPSim, the accident and emergency simulator and the outpatient simulator, may be used independently as stand-alone simulators of these hospital functions. The DGHPSim suite incorporates a novel way of simulating the multitasking behavior of clinicians and uses transition matrices, extracted from standard datasets, to represent the states through which patients pass and the wards in which they may be treated. As a whole, the DGHPSim suite may be used to investigate improvement options before their implementation or to investigate how a hospital has improved its performance. We show how DGHPSim is used to investigate reported performance improvements in an English general hospital."}
