The generality of the paradigm makes it applicable to many types of computing systems and, previously, researchers started to introduce concepts of self-awareness to multicore architectures. In our work we build on a recent reference architectural framework as a model for self-aware computing and instantiate it for an FPGA-based heterogeneous multicore running the ReconOS reconfigurable architecture and operating system. After presenting the model for self-aware computing and ReconOS, we demonstrate with a case study how a multicore application built on the principle of self-awareness, autonomously adapts to changes in the workload and system state. Our work shows that the reference architectural framework as a model for self-aware computing can be practically applied and allows us to structure and simplify the design process, which is essential for designing complex future computing systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21851","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21851","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3089","fieldValue":"Wang, Ting-Xuan"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3089","fieldValue":"Lu, Wen-Hsiang"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3089","fieldValue":" Nowadays, due to the explosive growth of web content and usage, users deal with their complex search tasks by web search engines. However, conventional search engines consider a search query corresponding only to a simple search task. In order to accomplish a complex search task, which consists of multiple subtask search goals, users usually have to issue a series of queries. For example, the complex search task â\u20ACœtravel to Dubaiâ\u20AC? may involve several subtask search goals, including reserving hotel room, surveying Dubai landmarks, booking flights, and so forth. Therefore, a user can efficiently accomplish his or her complex search task if search engines can predict the complex search task with a variety of subtask search goals. In this work, we propose a complex search task model (CSTM) to deal with this problem. The CSTM first groups queries into complex search task clusters, and then generates subtask search goals from each complex search task cluster. To raise the performance of CSTM, we exploit four web resources including community question answering, query logs, search engine result pages, and clicked pages. Experimental results show that our CSTM is effective in identifying the comprehensive subtask search goals of a complex search task."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3089","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3089","fieldValue":"ACM"}
