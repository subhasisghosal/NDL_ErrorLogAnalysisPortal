{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6206","fieldValue":" In the last decade, it has become apparent that embedded systems are integral parts of our every day lives. The wireless nature of many embedded applications as well as their omnipresence has made the need for security and privacy preserving mechanisms particularly important. Thus, as field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) become integral parts of embedded systems, it is imperative to consider their security as a whole. This contribution provides a state-of-the-art description of security issues on FPGAs, both from the system and implementation perspectives. We discuss the advantages of reconfigurable hardware for cryptographic applications, show potential security problems of FPGAs, and provide a list of open research problems. Moreover, we summarize both public and symmetric-key algorithm implementations on FPGAs."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6206","fieldValue":"FPGA"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6206","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6206","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6207","fieldValue":"Reyhani-Masoleh, Arash"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6207","fieldValue":" In this article, two digit-serial architectures for normal basis multipliers over (GF(2m)) are presented. These two structures have the same gate count and gate delay. We also consider two special cases of optimal normal bases for the two digit-serial architectures. A straightforward implementation leaves gate redundancy in both of them. An algorithm that can considerably reduce the redundancy is also developed. The proposed architectures are compared with the existing ones in terms of gate and time complexities."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6207","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6207","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6208","fieldValue":"Reyhani-Masoleh, Arash"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6208","fieldValue":" Cryptographic schemes, such as authentication, confidentiality, and integrity, rely on computations in very large finite fields, whose hardware realization may require millions of logic gates. In a straightforward design, even a single fault in such a complex circuit is likely to yield an incorrect result and may be exploited by an attacker to break the cryptosystem. In this regard, we consider computing over finite fields in presence of certain faults in multiplier circuits. Our work reported here deals with errors caused by such faults in polynomial basis multipliers over finite fields of characteristic two and presents a scheme to correct single errors. Towards this, pertinent theoretical results are derived, and both bit-parallel and bit-serial fault tolerant multipliers are proposed."}
