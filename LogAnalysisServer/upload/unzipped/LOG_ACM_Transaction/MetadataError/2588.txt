{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18719","fieldValue":" A numerical evaluator for the confluent hypergeometric function for complex arguments with large magnitudes using a direct summation of Kummer's series is presented. Extended precision subroutines using large arrays to accumulate a single numerator and denominator are ultimately used in a single division to arrive at the final result. The accuracy has been verified through a variety of tests and they show the evaluator to be consistently accurate to 13 significant figures, and on rare occasion accurate to only 9 for magnitudes of the arguments ranging into the thousands in any quadrant in the complex plane. Because the evaluator automatically determines the number of significant figures of machine precision, and because it is written in FORTRAN 77, tests on various computers have shown the evaluator to provide consistently accurate results, making the evaluator very portable. The principal drawback is that, for certain arguments, the evaluator is slow; however, the evaluator remains valuable as a benchmark even in such cases."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18719","fieldValue":"Algorithm 707: CONHYP: a numerical evaluator of the confluent hypergeometric function for complex arguments of large magnitudes"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18719","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18719","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.relation.haspart","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_HASPART","handle":"12345678_acm\/2761","fieldValue":"[{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"October 2013\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/2810\",\"title\":\"Issue 4, October 2013\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"August 2013\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/2809\",\"title\":\"Issue 3, August 2013\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"June 2013\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/2808\",\"title\":\"Issue 2, June 2013\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"March 2013\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/2807\",\"title\":\"Issue 1, March 2013\"}]"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18720","fieldValue":" An exact and practical method for determining the number, location, and multiplicity of all real zeros of the trigonometric polynomials is described. All computations can be performed without loss of accuracy. lThe method is based on zero isolation techniques for algebraic polynomials. An efficient method for the calculation of the coefficients of a corresponding algebraic polynomial is stated. The complexity of trigonometric zero isolation depending on the degree and the coefficient size of the given trigonometric polynomial is analyzed. In an experimental evaluation, the performance of the method is compared to the performance of recently developed numeric techniques for the approximate determination of all roots of trigonometric polynomials. The case of exponential or hyperbolic polynomials is treated in an appendix."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18720","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18720","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18721","fieldValue":" An algorithm is given for evaluating the incomplete beta function ratio Ix(a,b) and its complement 1 - Ix(a,b).
