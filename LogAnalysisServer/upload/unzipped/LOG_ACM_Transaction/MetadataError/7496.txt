We begin with a wireless communication network in which n nodes (agents), which might have different utility functions, contend for access on a common, wireless communication channel. We characterize this distributed multiple-access problem in terms of a one-shot random-access game, and then analyze the behavior of the nodes using the tools of game theory. We give necessary and sufficient conditions on nodes for the complete characterization of the Nash equilibria of this game for all n â\u2030¥ 2. We show that all centrally controlled optimal solutions are a subset of this game theoretic solution, and almost all (w.r.t. Lebesgue measure) transmission probability assignments chosen by a central authority are supported by the game theoretic solution. We analyze the behavior of the network throughput at Nash equilibria as a function of the costs of the transmitters incurred by failed transmissions. Finally, we conclude the paper with the asymptotic analysis of the system as the number of transmitters goes to infinity. We show that the asymptotic distribution of the packet arrivals converges in distribution to a Poisson random variable, and the channel throughput converges to - (c\/ (1 + c)) In (c\/ (1 + c)) with c > 0 being the cost of failed transmissions. We also give the best possible bounds on the rates of convergence of the packet arrival distribution and the channel throughput."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9801","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9801","fieldValue":"The analysis of Nash equilibria of the one-shot random-access game for wireless networks and the behavior of selfish nodes"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9801","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9801","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/9802","fieldValue":"Chua, Kee-Chaing"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9802","fieldValue":" We investigate the benefits of a heterogeneous architecture for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) composed of a few resource rich mobile relay nodes and a large number of simple static nodes. The mobile relays have more energy than the static sensors. They can dynamically move around the network and help relieve sensors that are heavily burdened by high network traffic, thus extending the latter's lifetime. We first study the performance of a large dense network with one mobile relay and show that network lifetime improves over that of a purely static network by up to a factor of four. Also, the mobile relay needs to stay only within a two-hop radius of the sink. We then construct a joint mobility and routing algorithm which can yield a network lifetime close to the upper bound. The advantage of this algorithm is that it only requires a limited number of nodes in the network to be aware of the location of the mobile relay. Our simulation results show that one mobile relay can at least double the network lifetime in a randomly deployed WSN. By comparing the mobile relay approach with various static energy-provisioning methods, we demonstrate the importance of node mobility for resource provisioning in a WSN."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9802","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
