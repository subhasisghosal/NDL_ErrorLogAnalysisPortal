This scheme controls the nonreal-time (controllable) traffic based on predicting the real-time (uncontrollable) traffic. The goal of the work is to operate the network in a low congestion, high throughput regime. We provide a rigorous analysis of the performance of our flow control method and show that the algorithm has attractive and useful properties. From our analysis we obtain an explicit condition that gives us design guidelines on how to choose a predictor. We learn that it is especially important to take the queueing effect into account in developing the predictor. We also provide numerical results comparing different predictors that use varying degrees of information from the network."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9290","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9290","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9290","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/1838","fieldValue":"Titos-Gil, Ruben"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1838","fieldValue":" This article describes cache designs for efficiently supporting speculative techniques like transactional memory on chip multiprocessors with multithreaded cores. On-demand allocation and prompt freeing of speculative cache space in the design reduces the burden on nonspeculative execution. Quick access to both clean and speculative versions of data for multiple contexts provides flexibility and greater design freedom to HTM architects. Performance analysis shows the designs stand up well against other HTM design proposals, with potential performance gains in high contention applications with small transactions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1838","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1838","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9291","fieldValue":" The Internet's excellent scalability and robustness result in part from the end-to-end nature of Internet congestion control. End-to-end congestion control algorithms alone, however, are unable to prevent the congestion collapse and unfairness created by applications that are unresponsive to network congestion. To address these maladies, we propose and investigate a novel congestion-avoidance mechanism called network border patrol (NBP). NBP entails the exchange of feedback between routers at the borders of a network in order to detect and restrict unresponsive traffic flows before they enter the network, thereby preventing congestion within the network. Moreover, NBP is complemented with the proposed enhanced core-stateless fair queueing (ECSFQ) mechanism, which provides fair bandwidth allocations to competing flows. Both NBP and ECSFQ are compliant with the Internet philosophy of pushing complexity toward the edges of the network whenever possible. Simulation results show that NBP effectively eliminates congestion collapse and that, when combined with ECSFQ, approximately max-min fair bandwidth allocations can be achieved for competing flows."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9291","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
