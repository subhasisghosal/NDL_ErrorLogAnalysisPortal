While multirate multicasting has been traditionally performed over fixed trees, advances in network coding theory have enabled higher throughput and have helped us move beyond the restriction of tree structures for routing the multicast data. In this paper, we address the questions of optimal rate allocation and low-complexity network coding solutions to the problem of multirate multicasting in general multihop networks. Our work considers intralayer network coding capabilities, where the session is conceptually divided into layers optimally and coding is performed across packets belonging to the same layer. Our approach differs from earlier works in this domain in its separation of the problem into rate allocation and content distribution items, which allows a number of optimization and graphical techniques in their solution. Noting the complexities involved in the optimal rate allocation and content distribution solutions, we then propose and investigate two novel approaches for reducing the complexity of the original scheme for more practical implementation based on a layered multicasting mechanism and nested optimization approach. We demonstrate the implementation advantages of these low-complexity schemes via extensive numerical studies."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10494","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10494","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10494","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10495","fieldValue":" Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are more likely to be distributed asynchronous systems. In this paper, we investigate the achievable data collection capacity of realistic distributed asynchronous WSNs. Our main contributions include five aspects. First, to avoid data transmission interference, we derive an Ro-proper carrier-sensing range (Ro - PCR) under the generalized physical interference model, where Ro is the satisfied threshold of data receiving rate. Taking Ro - PCR as its carrier-sensing range, any sensor node can initiate a data transmission with a guaranteed data receiving rate. Second, based on Ro - PCR, we propose a Distributed Data Collection (DDC) algorithm with fairness consideration. Theoretical analysis of DDC surprisingly shows that its achievable network capacity is order-optimal and independent of network size. Thus, DDC is scalable. Third, we discuss how to apply Ro - PCR to the distributed data aggregation problem and propose a Distributed Data Aggregation (DDA) algorithm. The delay performance of DDA is also analyzed. Fourth, to be more general, we study the delay and capacity of DDC and DDA under the Poisson node distribution model. The analysis demonstrates that DDC is also scalable and order-optimal under the Poisson distribution model. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations to validate the performance of DDC and DDA."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10495","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10495","fieldValue":"Distributed data collection in large-scale asynchronous wireless sensor networks under the generalized physical interference model"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10495","fieldValue":"ACM"}
