Negulescu et al. found that the lack of feedback on attempted motion gestures made it difficult for participants to diagnose and correct errors, resulting in poor recognition performance and user frustration. In this article, we describe and evaluate a training and feedback technique, Glissando, which uses audio characteristics to provide feedback on the systemâ\u20AC™s interpretation of user input. This technique enables feedback by verbally confirming correct gestures and notifying users of errors in addition to providing continuous feedback by manipulating the pitch of distinct musical notes mapped to each of three dimensional axes in order to provide both spatial and temporal information."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3528","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3528","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3529","fieldValue":" Abstract expressionism is a school of art characterized by nonrepresentational paintings where color, composition, and brush strokes are used to express emotion. These works are often misunderstood by the public who see them as requiring no skill and as images that even a child could have created. However, a recent series of studies has shown that ordinary adults untrained in art or art history, as well as young children, can differentiate paintings by abstract expressionists and superficially similar works by preschool children and even animals (monkeys, apes, elephants). Adults perform this distinction with an accuracy rate of âˆ¼64&percnt;, significantly higher than chance. Here we ask whether machine perception can do as well. Using the same paintings, we show that in âˆ¼68&percnt; of the cases the computer algorithm can discriminate between abstract paintings and the work of children and animals. We also applied a method that computes the correlation between the degree of artisticity deduced from human perception of the paintings and the visual content of the images, and we show significant correlation between perceived artisticity and visual content. The image content descriptor that was the strongest predictor of correct identification was the fractality of the painting. We also show that the computer algorithm predicts the perceived intentionality of the paintings by humans. These results confirm perceptible differences between works by abstract expressionists and superficially similar ones by the untrained and show that people see more than they think they see when looking at abstract expressionism."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3529","fieldValue":"Distinguishing between Abstract Art by Artists vs. Children and Animals: Comparison between Human and Machine Perception"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3529","fieldValue":"ACM"}
