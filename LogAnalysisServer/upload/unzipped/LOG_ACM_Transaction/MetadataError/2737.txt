For the sake of portability, simplicity, flexibility and efficiency the GMRES solvers have been implemented in Fortran 77 using the reverse communication mechanism for the matrix-vector product, the preconditioning and the dot product computations. For distributed memory computation, several orthogonalization procedures have been implemented to reduce the cost of the dot product calculation, which is a well-known bottleneck of efficiency for the Krylov methods. Either implicit or explicit calculation of the residual at restart are possible depending on the actual cost of the matrix-vector product. Finally the implemented stopping criterion is based on a normwise backward error."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19102","fieldValue":"GMRES"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19102","fieldValue":"Algorithm 842: A set of GMRES routines for real and complex arithmetics on high performance computers"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19102","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19102","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19103","fieldValue":" The Schwarz--Christoffel Toolbox (SC Toolbox) for MATLAB, first released in 1994, made possible the interactive creation and visualization of conformal maps to regions bounded by polygons. The most recent release supports new features, including an object-oriented command-line interface model, new algorithms for multiply elongated and multiple-sheeted regions, and a module for solving Laplace's equation on a polygon with Dirichlet and homogeneous Neumann conditions. Brief examples are given to demonstrate the new capabilities."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19103","fieldValue":"MATLAB"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19103","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19103","fieldValue":"ACM"}
