Despite its simplicity and general efficiency, this strategy alone does not guarantee delivery due to the existence of local minima (or dead ends). Overcoming local minima requires nodes to maintain extra nonlocal state or to use auxiliary mechanisms. We study how to facilitate greedy forwarding by using a minimum amount of such nonlocal states in topologically complex networks. Specifically, we investigate the problem of decomposing a given network into a minimum number of greedily routable components (GRCs), where greedy routing is guaranteed to work. We approach it by considering an approximate version of the problem in a continuous domain, with a central concept called the greedily routable region (GRR). A full characterization of GRR is given concerning its geometric properties and routing capability. We then develop simple approximate algorithms for the problem. These results lead to a practical routing protocol that has a routing stretch below 7 in a continuous domain, and close to 1 in several realistic network settings."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10318","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10318","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10318","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10319","fieldValue":" The deployment of cognitive radio networks enables efficient spectrum sharing and opportunistic spectrum access. It also presents new challenges to the classical problem of interference management in wireless networks. This paper develops an axiomatic framework for power allocation in cognitive radio networks based on four goals: QoS protection to primary users, opportunism to secondary users, admissibility to secondary users, and autonomous operation by individual users. Two additional goals, licensing and versatility, which are desirable rather than essential, are also presented. A general class of Duo Priority Class Power Control (DPCPC) policies that satisfy such goals is introduced. Through theoretical analysis and simulation, it is shown that a specific interference-aware power-control algorithm reaches such goals."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10319","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10319","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10319","fieldValue":"ACM"}
