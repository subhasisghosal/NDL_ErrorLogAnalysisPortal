In the first part of this article, we formulate the problem as a constrained convex optimization problem with tunable parameters. Then we propose an online algorithm that adaptively determines the optimization parameters to robustly estimate the breakdown information. The proposed solution is evaluated by experiment using a scaled-down proof-of-concept prototype with real measurements. In the second part, we provide detailed analysis to understand the performance of our proposed algorithm. We first develop a stochastic model to describe evolution of appliances‚\u20ACô ON\/OFF states using continuous-time Markov chain. Then we derive analytical bounds of estimation error and the probability of a rank-deficient binary matrix. Those analytical bounds are verified by extensive simulations. Finally, we study the effect of collinearity of binary data matrix on estimation performance. Simulation results suggest that our algorithm is robust against the collinearity of binary dataset."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21523","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21523","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21524","fieldValue":"Martin, Keith M"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21524","fieldValue":"Ng, Siaw-Lynn"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21524","fieldValue":"Paterson, Maura B"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21524","fieldValue":"Stinson, Douglas R"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21524","fieldValue":" We present a formalisation of a category of schemes that we refer to as broadcast-enhanced key predistribution schemes (BEKPSs). These schemes are suitable for networks with access to a trusted base station and an authenticated broadcast channel. We demonstrate that the access to these extra resources allows for the creation of BEKPSs with advantages over key predistribution schemes such as flexibility and more efficient revocation. There are many possible ways to implement BEKPSs, and we propose a framework for describing and analysing them. In their paper ‚\u20ACúFrom Key Predistribution to Key Redistribution,‚\u20AC? Cicho≈\u201E et al. [2010] propose a scheme for ‚\u20ACúredistributing‚\u20AC? keys to a wireless sensor network using a broadcast channel after an initial key predistribution. We classify this as a BEKPS and analyse it in that context. We provide simpler proofs of some results from their paper, give a precise analysis of the resilience of their scheme, and discuss possible modifications. We then study two scenarios where BEKPSs may be particularly desirable and propose a suitable family of BEKPSs for each case. We demonstrate that they are practical and efficient to implement, and our analysis shows their effectiveness in achieving suitable trade-offs between the conflicting priorities in resource-constrained networks."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21524","fieldValue":"ACM"}
