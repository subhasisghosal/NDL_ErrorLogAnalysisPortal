Existing algorithms in this domain fail to fulfill at least one of five physical desiderata. To address this we present a simple generalized impact model motivated by both the successes and pitfalls of two popular approaches: pair-wise propagation and linear complementarity models. Our algorithm is the first to satisfy all identified desiderata, including simultaneously guaranteeing symmetry preservation, kinetic energy conservation, and allowing break-away. Furthermore, we address the associated problem of inelastic collapse, proposing a complementary generalized restitution model that eliminates this source of nontermination. We then consider the application of our models to the synchronous time-integration of large-scale assemblies of impacting rigid bodies. To enable such simulations we formulate a consistent frictional impact model that continues to satisfy the desiderata. Finally, we validate our proposed algorithm by correctly capturing the observed characteristics of physical experiments including the phenomenon of extended patterns in vertically oscillated granular materials."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16695","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16695","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2582","fieldValue":" The problems of random projections and sparse reconstruction have much in common and individually received much attention. Surprisingly, until now they progressed in parallel and remained mostly separate. Here, we employ new tools from probability in Banach spaces that were successfully used in the context of sparse reconstruction to advance on an open problem in random pojection. In particular, we generalize and use an intricate result by Rudelson and Veshynin [2008] for sparse reconstruction which uses Dudleyâ\u20AC™s theorem for bounding Gaussian processes. Our main result states that any set of N = exp(Ã\u2022(n)) real vectors in n dimensional space can be linearly mapped to a space of dimension k = O(log N polylog(n)), while (1) preserving the pairwise distances among the vectors to within any constant distortion and (2) being able to apply the transformation in time O(n log n) on each vector. This improves on the best known bound N = $exp(Ã\u2022(n^1\/2)) achieved by Ailon and Liberty [2009] and N = exp(Ã\u2022(n1\/3$)) by Ailon and Chazelle [2010]. The dependence in the distortion constant however is suboptimal, and since the publication of an early version of the work, the gap between upper and lower bounds has been considerably tightened obtained by Krahmer and Ward [2011]. For constant distortion, this settles the open question posed by these authors up to a polylog(n) factor while considerably simplifying their constructions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2582","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2582","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16696","fieldValue":" We present a simple algorithm to compute continuous penalty forces to determine collision response between rigid and deformable models bounded by triangle meshes. Our algorithm computes a well-behaved solution in contrast to the traditional stability and robustness problems of penalty methods, induced by force discontinuities. We trace contact features along their deforming trajectories and accumulate penalty forces along the penetration time intervals between the overlapping feature pairs. Moreover, we present a closed-form expression to compute the continuous and smooth collision response. Our method has very small additional overhead compared to previous penalty methods, and can significantly improve the stability and robustness. We highlight its benefits on several benchmarks."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16696","fieldValue":"ACM"}
