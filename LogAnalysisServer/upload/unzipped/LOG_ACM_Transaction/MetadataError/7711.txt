{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10233","fieldValue":" The back-pressure algorithm is a well-known throughput-optimal algorithm. However, its implementation requires that each node has to maintain a separate queue for each commodity in the network, and only one queue is served at a time. This fact may lead to a poor delay performance even when the traffic load is not close to network capacity. Also, since the number of commodities in the network is usually very large, the queueing data structure that has to be maintained at each node is respectively complex. In this paper, we present a solution to address both of these issues in the case of a fixed-routing network scenario where the route of each flow is chosen upon arrival. Our proposed architecture allows each node to maintain only per-neighbor queues and, moreover, improves the delay performance of the back-pressure algorithm."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10233","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10233","fieldValue":"A novel architecture for reduction of delay and queueing structure complexity in the back-pressure algorithm"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10233","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10233","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10234","fieldValue":" Communication networks are vulnerable to natural disasters, such as earthquakes or floods, as well as to physical attacks, such as an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack. Such real-world events happen in specific geographical locations and disrupt specific parts of the network. Therefore, the geographical layout of the network determines the impact of such events on the network's connectivity. In this paper, we focus on assessing the vulnerability of (geographical) networks to such disasters. In particular, we aim to identify the most vulnerable parts of the network. That is, the locations of disasters that would have the maximum disruptive effect on the network in terms of capacity and connectivity. We consider graph models in which nodes and links are geographically located on a plane. First, we consider a simplistic bipartite graph model and present a polynomial-time algorithm for finding a worst-case vertical line segment cut. We then generalize the network model to graphs with nodes at arbitrary locations.We model the disaster event as a line segment or a disk and develop polynomial-time algorithms that find a worst-case line segment cut and a worst-case circular cut. Finally, we obtain numerical results for a specific backbone network, thereby demonstrating the applicability of our algorithms to real-world networks. Our novel approach provides a promising new direction for network design to avert geographical disasters or attacks."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10234","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10234","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10234","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10235","fieldValue":" A foundational issue underlying many overlay network applications ranging from routing to peer-to-peer file sharing is that of the network formation, i.e., folding new arrivals into an existing overlay, and rewiring to cope with changing network conditions. Previous work has considered the problem from two perspectives: devising practical heuristics for the case of cooperative peers and performing game-theoretic analysis for the case of selfish peers. In this paper, we unify the aforementioned thrusts by defining and studying the selfish neighbor selection (SNS) game and its application to overlay routing. At the heart of SNS stands the restriction that peers are allowed up to a certain number of neighbors. This makes SNS substantially different from existing network formation games that impose no bounds on peer degrees. Having bounded degrees has important practical consequences as it permits the creation of overlay structures that require O(n) instead of $O(n^2$) link monitoring overhead. We show that a node's \"best response\" wiring strategy amounts to solving a k-median problem on asymmetric distance. Best-response wirings have substantial practical utility as they permit selfish nodes to reap substantial performance benefits when connecting to overlays of nonselfish nodes. A more intricate consequence is that even nonselfish nodes can benefit from the existence of some selfish nodes since the latter, via their local optimizations, create a highly optimized backbone, upon which even simple heuristic wirings yield good performance. To capitalize on the above properties, we design, build, and deploy EGOIST, an SNS-inspired prototype overlay routing system for PlanetLab. We demonstrate that EGOIST outperforms existing heuristic overlays on a variety of performance metrics, including delay, available bandwidth, and node utilization, while it remains competitive with an optimal but unscalable full-mesh overlay."}
