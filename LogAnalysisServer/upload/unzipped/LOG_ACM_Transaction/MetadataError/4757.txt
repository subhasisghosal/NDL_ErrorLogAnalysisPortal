Deployments involve careful design of many mechanisms where content attributes and usage models should be taken into account. We define, and propose a methodology to solve, the VoD Equipment Allocation Problem of determining the number and type of streaming servers with directly attached storage (VoD servers) to install at each potential location in a metropolitan area network topology such that deployment costs are minimized. We develop a cost model for VoD deployments based on streaming, storage and transport costs and train a parametric function that maps the amount of available storage to a worst-case hit ratio. We observe the impact of having to determine the amount of storage and streaming cojointly, and determine the minimum demand required to deploy replicas as well as the average hit ratio at each location. We observe that common video-on-demand server configurations lead to the installation of excessive storage, because a relatively high hit-ratio can be achieved with small amounts of storage so streaming requirements dominate."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25328","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25328","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25329","fieldValue":" In our everyday life, we communicate with many people such as family, friends, neighbors, and colleagues. We communicate with them using different communication media such as email, telephone calls, and face-to-face interactions. While email is not real-time and face-to-face communications require geographic proximity, voice and video communications are preferred over other modes of communication. However, real-time voice\/video calls may create nuisance to the receiver. In this article, we describe a mathematical model for computing nuisance level of incoming voice\/video calls. We computed the closeness and nuisance level using the calling patterns between the caller and the callee. To validate the nuisance model, we collected cell phone call records of real-life people at our university and computed the nuisance value for all voice calls. We validated the nuisance levels using the feedback from those real-life people. Such a nuisance model is useful for predicting unwanted voice and video sessions in an IP communication network."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25329","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25329","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25330","fieldValue":"Zheng, Qing-Fang"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25330","fieldValue":" The explosion of multimedia data necessitates effective and efficient ways for us to get access to our desired ones. In this article, we draw an analogy between image retrieval and text retrieval and propose a visual phrase-based approach to retrieve images containing desired objects (object-based image retrieval). The visual phrase is defined as a pair of frequently co-occurred adjacent local image patches and is constructed using data mining. We design methods on how to construct visual phrase and how to index\/search images based on visual phrase. We demonstrate experiments to show our visual phrase-based approach can be very efficient and more effective than current visual word-based approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25330","fieldValue":"SIFT"}
