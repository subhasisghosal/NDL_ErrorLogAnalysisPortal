We present a control-theoretic algorithm to counteract uncooperative users which change their congestion control schemes to gain larger bandwidth. This algorithm rectifies uncooperative users; that is, forces them to comply with their fair share, by adjusting the prices fed back to them. It is to be implemented at the edge of the network (e.g., by ISPs), and can be used with any congestion notification policy deployed by the network. Our design achieves a separation of time-scales between the network congestion feedback loop and the price-adjustment loop, thus recovering the fair allocation of bandwidth upon a fast transient phase."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9546","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9546","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9546","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9547","fieldValue":" Most existing reliable multicast congestion control (RMCC) mechanisms try to emulate TCP congestion control behaviors for achieving TCP-compatibility. However, different loss recovery mechanisms employed in reliable multicast protocols, especially NAK-based retransmission and local loss recovery mechanisms, may lead to different behaviors and performance of congestion control. As a result, reliable multicast flows might be identified and treated as non-TCP-friendly by routers in the network. It is essential to understand those influences and take them into account in the development and deployment of reliable multicast services. In this paper, we study the influences comprehensively through analysis, modelling and simulations. We demonstrate that NAK-based retransmission and\/or local loss recovery mechanisms are much more robust and efficient in recovering from single or multiple packet losses within a single round-trip time (RTT). For a better understanding on the impact of loss recovery on RMCC, we derive expressions for steady-state throughput of NAK-based RMCC schemes, which clearly brings out the throughput advantages of NAK-based RMCC over TCP Reno. We also show that timeout effects have little impact on shaping the performance of NAK-based RMCC schemes except for extremely high loss rates (>0.2). Finally, we use simulations to validate our findings and show that local loss recovery may further increase the throughput and deteriorate the fairness properties of NAK-based RMCC schemes. These findings and insights could provide useful recommendations for the design, testing and deployment of reliable multicast protocols and services."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9547","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9547","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9547","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/1862","fieldValue":"Aamodt, Tor M"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1862","fieldValue":" As the number of cores and threads in throughput accelerators such as Graphics Processing Units (GPU) increases, so does the importance of on-chip interconnection network design. This article explores throughput-effective Network-on-Chips (NoC) for future compute accelerators that employ Bulk-Synchronous Parallel (BSP) programming models such as CUDA and OpenCL. A hardware optimization is â\u20ACœthroughput effectiveâ\u20AC? if it improves parallel application-level performance per unit chip area. We evaluate performance of future looking workloads using detailed closed-loop simulations modeling compute nodes, NoC, and the DRAM memory system. We start from a mesh design with bisection bandwidth balanced to off-chip demand. Accelerator workloads tend to demand high off-chip memory bandwidth which results in a many-to-few traffic pattern when coupled with expected technology constraints of slow growth in pins-per-chip. Leveraging these observations we reduce NoC area by proposing a â\u20ACœcheckerboardâ\u20AC? NoC which alternates between conventional full routers and half routers with limited connectivity. Next, we show that increasing network terminal bandwidth at the nodes connected to DRAM controllers alleviates a significant fraction of the remaining imbalance resulting from the many-to-few traffic pattern. Furthermore, we propose a â\u20ACœdouble checkerboard invertedâ\u20AC? NoC organization which takes advantage of channel slicing to reduce area while maintaining the performance improvements of the aforementioned techniques. This organization also has a simpler routing mechanism and improves average application throughput per unit area by 24.3&percnt;."}
