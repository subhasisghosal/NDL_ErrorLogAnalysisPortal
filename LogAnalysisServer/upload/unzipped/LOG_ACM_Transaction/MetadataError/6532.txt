However, individual works have focused on sophisticated methodologies with particular sport types and there has been a lack of scalable and holistic frameworks in this field. This article proposes a solution and presents a systematic and generic approach which is experimented on a relatively large-scale sports consortia. The system aims at the event detection scenario of an input video with an orderly sequential process. Initially, domain knowledge-independent local descriptors are extracted homogeneously from the input video sequence. Then the video representation is created by adopting a bag-of-visual-words (BoW) model. The videoâ\u20AC™s genre is first identified by applying the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifiers on the initially obtained video representation, and various dissimilarity measures are assessed and evaluated analytically. Subsequently, an unsupervised probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA)-based approach is employed at the same histogram-based video representation, characterizing each frame of video sequence into one of four view groups, namely closed-up-view, mid-view, long-view, and outer-field-view. Finally, a hidden conditional random field (HCRF) structured prediction model is utilized for interesting event detection. From experimental results, k-NN classifier using KL-divergence measurement demonstrates the best accuracy at 82.16&percnt; for genre categorization. Supervised SVM and unsupervised PLSA have average classification accuracies at 82.86&percnt; and 68.13&percnt;, respectively. The HCRF model achieves 92.31&percnt; accuracy using the unsupervised PLSA based label input, which is comparable with the supervised SVM based input at an accuracy of 93.08&percnt;. In general, such a systematic approach can be widely applied in processing massive videos generically."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7411","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7411","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7412","fieldValue":"Leung, Clement H C"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7412","fieldValue":"Chan, Alice W S"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7412","fieldValue":" Effective sharing of diverse social media is often inhibited by limitations in their search and discovery mechanisms, which are particularly restrictive for media that do not lend themselves to automatic processing or indexing. Here, we present the structure and mechanism of an adaptive search engine which is designed to overcome such limitations. The basic framework of the adaptive search engine is to capture human judgment in the course of normal usage from user queries in order to develop semantic indexes which link search terms to media objects semantics. This approach is particularly effective for the retrieval of multimedia objects, such as images, sounds, and videos, where a direct analysis of the object features does not allow them to be linked to search terms, for example, nontextual\/icon-based search, deep semantic search, or when search terms are unknown at the time the media repository is built. An adaptive search architecture is presented to enable the index to evolve with respect to user feedback, while a randomized query-processing technique guarantees avoiding local minima and allows the meaningful indexing of new media objects and new terms. The present adaptive search engine allows for the efficient community creation and updating of social media indexes, which is able to instill and propagate deep knowledge into social media concerning the advanced search and usage of media resources. Experiments with various relevance distribution settings have shown efficient convergence of such indexes, which enable intelligent search and sharing of social media resources that are otherwise hard to discover."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7412","fieldValue":"ACM"}
