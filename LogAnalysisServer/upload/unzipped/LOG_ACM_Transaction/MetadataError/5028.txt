{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3738","fieldValue":" Speech separation can be formulated as a classification problem. In classification-based speech separation, supervised learning is employed to classify time-frequency units as either speech-dominant or noise-dominant. In very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions, acoustic features extracted from a mixture are crucial for correct classification. In this study, we systematically evaluate a range of promising features for classification-based separation using six nonstationary noises at the low SNR level of -5 dB, which is chosen with the goal of improving human speech intelligibility in mind. In addition, we propose a new feature called multi-resolution cochleagram (MRCG). The new feature is constructed by combining four cochleagrams at different spectrotemporal resolutions in order to capture both the local and contextual information. Experimental results show that MRCG gives the best classification results among all evaluated features. In addition, our results indicate that auto-regressive moving average (ARMA) filtering, a post-processing technique for improving automatic speech recognition features, also improves many acoustic features for speech separation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3738","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3738","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3739","fieldValue":"Van Mourik, Jelle"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3739","fieldValue":" The Finite Difference Time Domain method is gaining popularity as a means to simulate and solve room acoustical problems. In this paper, a new set of stencils is defined that approximate the wave equation with a high degree of accuracy and lower dispersion error. Compared to the previously presented optimal scheme, the Interpolated Wideband scheme, our schemes are computationally less demanding and more practical to implement. They use at least 8 times less memory for the same audio rate and are an order of magnitude faster, although the former has a higher valid bandwidth. Despite their larger computational expense per node update, it is shown that our schemes on the whole use less memory and computation time than the Standard Rectilinear stencil, particularly when GPU implementations are employed. Lastly, a new way of visualizing and comparing valid bandwidth is recommended."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3739","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3739","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3740","fieldValue":" Binaural noise-reduction algorithms based on multi-channel Wiener filter (MWF) are promising techniques to be used in binaural assistive listening devices. The real-time implementation of the existing binaural MWF methods, however, involves challenges to increase the amount of noise reduction without imposing speech distortion, and at the same time preserving the binaural cues of both speech and noise components. Although significant efforts have been made in the literature, most developed methods so far have focused only on either the former or latter problem. This paper proposes an alternative binaural MWF algorithm that incorporates the nonstationarity of the signal components into the framework. The main objective is to design an algorithm that would be able to select the sources that are present in the environment. To achieve this, a modified speech presence probability (SPP) and a single-channel speech enhancement algorithm are utilized in the formulation. The resulting optimal filter also avoids the poor estimation of the second-order clean speech statistics, which is normally done by simple subtraction. Theoretical analysis and performance evaluation using realistic recorded data shows the advantage of the proposed method over the reference MWF solution in terms of the binaural cues preservation, as well as the noise reduction and speech distortion."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3740","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3740","fieldValue":"ACM"}
