{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4368","fieldValue":" The recent explosion in procurement and availability of high-dimensional gene- and protein-expression profile datasets for cancer diagnostics has necessitated the development of sophisticated machine learning tools with which to analyze them. A major limitation in the ability to accurate classify these high-dimensional datasets stems from the 'curse of dimensionality', occurring in situations where the number of genes or peptides significantly exceeds the total number of patient samples. Previous attempts at dealing with this issue have mostly centered on the use of a dimensionality reduction (DR) scheme, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to obtain a low-dimensional projection of the high-dimensional data. However, linear PCA and other linear DR methods, which rely on Euclidean distances to estimate object similarity, do not account for the inherent underlying nonlinear structure associated with most biomedical data. The motivation behind this work is to identify the appropriate DR methods for analysis of high-dimensional gene- and protein-expression studies. Towards this end, we empirically and rigorously compare three nonlinear (Isomap, Locally Linear Embedding, Laplacian Eigenmaps) and three linear DR schemes (PCA, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Multidimensional Scaling) with the intent of determining a reduced subspace representation in which the individual object classes are more easily discriminable."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4368","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4368","fieldValue":"Bioinformatics (genome or protein) databases, Clustering, classification, and association rules, Data and knowledge visualization, Data mining, Feature extraction or construction"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4368","fieldValue":"Investigating the Efficacy of Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction Schemes in Classifying Gene and Protein Expression Studies"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4368","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4368","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4369","fieldValue":" It is a consensus in microarray analysis that identifying potential local patterns, characterized by coherent groups of genes and conditions, may shed light on the discovery of previously undetectable biological cellular processes of genes as well as macroscopic phenotypes of related samples. In order to simultaneously cluster genes and conditions, we have previously developed a fast co-clustering algorithm, Minimum Sum-Squared Residue Co-clustering (MSSRCC), which employs an alternating minimization scheme and generates what we call co-clusters in a checkerboard structure. In this paper, we propose specific strategies that enable MSSRCC to escape poor local minima and resolve the degeneracy problem in partitional clustering algorithms. The strategies include binormalization, deterministic spectral initialization, and incremental local search. We assess the effects of various strategies on both synthetic gene expression datasets and real human cancer microarrays and provide empirical evidence that MSSRCC with the proposed strategies performs better than existing co-clustering and clustering algorithms. In particular, the combination of all the three strategies leads to the best performance. Furthermore, we illustrate coherence of the resulting co-clusters in a checkerboard structure, where genes in a co-cluster manifest the phenotype structure of corresponding specific samples, and evaluate the enrichment of functional annotations in Gene Ontology (GO)."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4369","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4369","fieldValue":"Microarray analysis, co-clustering, binormalization, deterministic spectral initialization, local search, Gene Ontology"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4369","fieldValue":"ACM"}
