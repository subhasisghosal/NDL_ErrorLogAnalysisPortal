The key contribution in our algorithm is the use of visibility of photon path as the importance function which ensures that our sampling algorithm focuses on paths that are visible from the given viewpoint. Our sampling algorithm builds on two recent developments in Markov chain Monte Carlo methods: adaptive Markov chain sampling and replica exchange. Using these techniques, each photon path is adaptively mutated and it explores the sampling space efficiently without being stuck at a local peak of the importance function. We have implemented this sampling approach in the progressive photon mapping algorithm which provides visibility information in a natural way when a photon path contributes to a measurement point. We demonstrate that the final algorithm is strikingly simple, yet effective at sampling photons under lighting conditions that would be difficult for existing Monte Carlo ray tracing-based methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16512","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16512","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16513","fieldValue":" Recent work demonstrates that interactive ray tracing is possible on desktop systems, but there is still much debate as to how to most efficiently support advanced visual effects such as soft shadows, smooth freeform surfaces, complex shading, and animated scenes. With these challenges in mind, we reconsider the options for designing a rendering system and present Razor, a new software rendering architecture for distribution ray tracing designed to produce high-quality images with high performance on future single-chip many-core hardware. Razor includes two noteworthy capabilities: a set of techniques for quickly building the kd-tree acceleration structure on demand every frame from a scene graph and a system design that allows for crack-free multiresolution geometry with each ray independently choosing its geometry resolution. Razor's per-frame kd-tree build is designed to robustly handle arbitrarily scene animation, while its per-ray multiresolution geometry provides continuous level of detail driven by ray and path differentials. Razor also decouples shading from visibility computations using a two-phase shading scheme inspired by the REYES system, and caches tessellated representations of freeform surfaces at multiple levels of detail. We present experimental results gathered from a prototype system implemented on eight CPU cores, and discuss which aspects of the system are most successful and which would benefit from further investigation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16513","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16513","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16514","fieldValue":"Vinacua, lvar"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16514","fieldValue":" We propose to measure the quality of an affine motion by its steadiness, which we formulate as the inverse of its Average Relative Acceleration (ARA). Steady affine motions, for which ARA&equal;0, include translations, rotations, screws, and the golden spiral. To facilitate the design of pleasing in-betweening motions that interpolate between an initial and a final pose (affine transformation), B and C, we propose the Steady Affine Morph (SAM), defined as $A^t&compfn; B with A &equal; C &compfn; Bâˆ\u20191. A SAM is affine-invariant and reversible. It preserves isometries (i.e., rigidity), similarities, and volume. Its velocity field is stationary both in the global and the local (moving) frames. Given a copy count, n, the series of uniformly sampled poses, A&fracin;&compfn; B, of a SAM form a regular pattern which may be easily controlled by changing B, C, or n, and where consecutive poses are related by the same affinity A&frac1n. Although a real matrix At does not always exist, we show that it does for a convex and large subset of orientation-preserving affinities A. Our fast and accurate Extraction of Affinity Roots (EAR) algorithm computes At$, when it exists, using closed-form expressions in two or in three dimensions. We discuss SAM applications to pattern design and animation and to key-frame interpolation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16514","fieldValue":"ACM"}
