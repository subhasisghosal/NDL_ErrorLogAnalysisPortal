Yet, routing behavior during BGP route convergence is poorly understood. During route convergence, an end-to-end Internet path can experience a transient loss of reachability. We refer to this loss of reachability as transient routing failure. Transient routing failures can lead to packet losses, and prolonged packet loss bursts can make the performance of applications such as Voice-over-IP and interactive games unacceptable. In this paper, we study how routing failures can occur in the Internet. With the aid of a formal model that captures transient failures of the interdomain routing protocol, we derive the sufficient conditions that transient routing failures could occur. We further study transient routing failures in typical BGP systems where commonly used routing policies are applied. Network administrators can apply our analysis to improve their network performance and stability."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9866","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9866","fieldValue":"BGP"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9866","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9866","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9867","fieldValue":" Two-phase routing, where traffic is first distributed to intermediate nodes before being routed to the final destination, has been recently proposed for handling widely fluctuating traffic without the need to adapt network routing to changing traffic. Preconfiguring the network in a traffic independent manner using two-phase routing simplifies network operation considerably. In this paper, we extend this routing scheme by providing resiliency against link failures through fast restoration along link backup detours. We view this as important progress towards adding carrier-class reliability to the robustness of the scheme so as to facilitate its future deployment in Internet Service Provider (ISP) networks. On the theoretical side, the main contribution of the paper is the development of linear programming based and fast combinatorial algorithms for two-phase routing with link restoration so as to minimize the maximum utilization of any link in the network, or equivalently, maximize the throughput. The algorithms developed are Fully Polynomial Time Approximation Schemes (FPTAS)--for any given Æ? > 0, an FPTAS guarantees a solution that is within a (1 + Æ?)-factor of the optimum and runs in time polynomial in the input size and 1\/Æ?. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work in the literature that considers making the scheme resilient to link failures through preprovisioned fast restoration mechanisms. We evaluate the performance of link restoration (in terms of throughput) and compare it with that of unprotected routing. For our experiments, we use actual ISP network topologies collected for the Rocketfuel project and three research network topologies."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9867","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9867","fieldValue":"ACM"}
