An objective function for the quality of a view sequence is derived from a novel task-oriented, model-based instantaneous coverage quality criterion and a criterion of the smoothness of view transitions over time. The former is quantified by a priori information about the camera system, environment, and task generally available in the target application class. The latter is derived from qualitative definitions of undesirable transition effects. A scalable online algorithm with robust suboptimal performance is presented based on this objective function. Experimental results demonstrate the performance of the methodâ\u20AC\u201Dand therefore the criteriaâ\u20AC\u201Das well as its robustness to several identified sources of nonsmoothness."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21483","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21483","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21484","fieldValue":" Phenomena clouds are characterized by nondeterministic, dynamic variations of shapes, sizes, direction, and speed of motion along multiple axes. The phenomena detection and tracking should not be limited to some traditional applications such as oil spills and gas clouds but also be utilized to more accurately observe other types of phenomena such as walking motion of people. This wider range of applications requires more reliable, in-situ techniques that can accurately adapt to the dynamics of phenomena. Unfortunately, existing works which only focus on simple and well-defined shapes of phenomena are no longer sufficient. In this article, we present a new class of applications together with several distributed algorithms to detect and track phenomena clouds, regardless of their shapes and movement direction. We first propose a distributed algorithm for in-situ detection and tracking of phenomena clouds in a sensor space. We next provide a mathematical model to optimize the energy consumption, on which we further propose a localized algorithm to minimize the resource utilization. Our proposed approaches not only ensure low processing and networking overhead at the centralized query processor but also minimize the number of sensors which are actively involved in the detection and tracking processes. We validate our approach using both real-life smart home applications and simulation experiments, which confirm the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms. We also show that our algorithms result in significant reduction in resource usage and power consumption as compared to contemporary stream-based approaches."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21484","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21484","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21485","fieldValue":"Kamal, Abu Raihan M"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21485","fieldValue":" Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technology has recently moved out of controlled laboratory settings to real-world deployments. Many of these deployments experience high rates of failure. Common types of failure include node failure, link failure, and node reboot. Due to the resource constraints of sensor nodes, existing techniques for fault detection in enterprise networks are not applicable. Previously proposed WSN fault detection algorithms either rely on periodic transmission of node status data or inferring node status based on passive information collection. The former approach significantly reduces network lifetime, while the latter achieves poor accuracy in dynamic or large networks. Herein, we propose Sequence-Based Fault Detection (SBFD), a novel framework for network fault detection in WSNs. The framework exploits in-network packet tagging using the Fletcher checksum and server-side network path analysis to efficiently deduce the path of all packets sent to the sink. The sink monitors the extracted packet paths to detect persistent path changes which are indicative of network failures. When a failure is suspected, the sink uses control messages to check the status of the affected nodes. SBFD was implemented in TinyOS on TelosB motes and its performance was assessed in a testbed network and in TOSSIM simulation. The method was found to achieve a fault detection accuracy of 90.7&percnt; to 95.0&percnt; for networks of 25 to 400 nodes at the cost of 0.164&percnt; to 0.239&percnt; additional control packets and a 0.5&percnt; reduction in node lifetime due to in-network packet tagging. Finally, a comparative study was conducted with existing solutions."}
