{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1736","fieldValue":" Cache-content-duplication (CCD) occurs when there is a miss for a block in a cache and the entire content of the missed block is already in the cache in a block with a different tag. Caches aware of content-duplication can have lower miss penalty by fetching, on a miss to a duplicate block, directly from the cache instead of accessing lower in the memory hierarchy, and can have lower miss rates by allowing only blocks with unique content to enter a cache. This work examines the potential of CCD for instruction caches. We show that CCD is a frequent phenomenon and that an idealized duplication-detection mechanism for instruction caches has the potential to increase performance of an out-of-order processor, with a 16KB, 8-way, 8 instructions per block instruction cache, often by more than 10&percnt; and up to 36&percnt;. This work also proposes CATCH, a hardware mechanism for dynamically detecting CCD for instruction caches. Experimental results for an out-of-order processor show that a duplication-detection mechanism with a 1.38KB cost captures on average 58&percnt; of the CCD's idealized potential."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1736","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1736","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8170","fieldValue":" The ability to predict consumer choices is essential in understanding the demand structure of products and services. Typical discrete choice models that are targeted at providing an understanding of the behavioral process leading to choice outcomes are developed around two main assumptions: the existence of a utility function that represents the preferences over a choice set and the relatively simple and interpretable functional form for the utility function with respect to attributes of alternatives and decision makers. These assumptions lead to models that can be easily interpreted to provide insights into the effects of individual variables, such as price and promotion, on consumer choices. However, these restrictive assumptions might impede the ability of such theory-driven models to deliver accurate predictions and forecasts. In this article, we develop novel approaches targeted at providing more accurate choice predictions. Specifically, we propose two prediction-driven approaches: pairwise preference learning using classification techniques and ranking function learning using evolutionary computation. We compare our proposed approaches with a multiclass classification approach, as well as a standard discrete choice model. Our empirical results show that the proposed approaches achieved significantly higher choice prediction accuracy."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8170","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8170","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8170","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/8171","fieldValue":"Ngo-Ye, Thomas L"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/8171","fieldValue":"Sinha, Atish P"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8171","fieldValue":" Within the emerging context of Web 2.0 social media, online customer reviews are playing an increasingly important role in disseminating information, facilitating trust, and promoting commerce in the e-marketplace. The sheer volume of customer reviews on the web produces information overload for readers. Developing a system that can automatically identify the most helpful reviews would be valuable to businesses that are interested in gathering informative and meaningful customer feedback. Because the target variable---review helpfulness---is continuous, common feature selection techniques from text classification cannot be applied. In this article, we propose and investigate a text mining model, enhanced using the Regressional ReliefF (RReliefF) feature selection method, for predicting the helpfulness of online reviews from Amazon.com. We find that RReliefF significantly outperforms two popular dimension reduction methods. This study is the first to investigate and compare different dimension reduction techniques in the context of applying text regression for predicting online review helpfulness. Another contribution is that our analysis of the keywords selected by RReliefF reveals meaningful feature groupings."}
