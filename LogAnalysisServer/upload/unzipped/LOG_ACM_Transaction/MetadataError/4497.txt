However, specific characteristics of real-world resources and queries, and their impact on P2P-based RD, are largely unknown. We analyze the characteristics of resources and queries using data from four real-world systems. These characteristics are then used to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the fundamental design choices for P2P-based multi-attribute RD. The datasets exhibit several noteworthy features that affect the performance. For example, compared to uniform queries, real-world queries are relatively easier to resolve using unstructured, superpeer, and single-attribute-dominated query-based structured P2P solutions, as queries mostly specify only a small subset of the available attributes and large ranges of attribute values. However, all the solutions are prone to significant load balancing issues, as the resources and queries are highly skewed and correlated. The implications of our findings for improving RD solutions are also discussed."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24497","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24497","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24498","fieldValue":" An unprecedented information wealth produced by online social networks, further augmented by location\/collocation data, is currently fragmented across different proprietary services. Combined, it can accurately represent the social world and enable novel socially aware applications. We present Prometheus, a socially aware peer-to-peer service that collects social information from multiple sources into a multigraph managed in a decentralized fashion on user-contributed nodes, and exposes it through an interface implementing nontrivial social inferences while complying with user-defined access policies. Simulations and experiments on PlanetLab with emulated application workloads show the system exhibits good end-to-end response time, low communication overhead, and resilience to malicious attacks."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24498","fieldValue":"Special Issue on Foundations of Social Computing: Enabling Social Applications via Decentralized Social Data Management"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24498","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24498","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24499","fieldValue":" A key challenge in online communities is that of keeping a community active and alive. All online communities work hard to keep their members through various initiatives, such as personalisation and recommendation technologies. In online communities aimed at supporting behavioural change, that is, in domains such as diet, lifestyle, or the environment, the main reason for participation is not to connect with real-world friends for sharing and communicating, but to meet and gain support from like-minded people in an online environment. Introducing personalisation and recommendation features in these networks is challenging, as traditional approaches leverage the densely populated friendship relations found in typical social networks, and these are not present in these new community types. We address this challenge by looking beyond the articulated friendships of a community for evidence of relationships. In particular, we look at the interactions of members of an online community with other members and resources. In this article, we present a social behaviour model and apply it to two types of recommendation systems, a people recommender and a content recommender system. We evaluate our systems using the interaction logs of an online diet and lifestyle community in which 5,000 Australians participated in a 12-week programme. Our results show that our social behaviour-based recommendation algorithms outperform baselines, friendship-based, and link-prediction algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24499","fieldValue":"ACM"}
