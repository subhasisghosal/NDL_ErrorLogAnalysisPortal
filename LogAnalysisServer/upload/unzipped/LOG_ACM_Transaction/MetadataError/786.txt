We introduce a portfolio-based approach to model checking. Our portfolio is first driven by an approximate runtime predictor that provides a heuristic approximation to a perfect oracle and suggests which engines are more suitable for each verification instance. Scalability and robustness of the overall model-checking effort highly rely on a concurrent, multithreaded model of execution. Following similar approaches in related application fields, we dovetail data partitioning, focused on proving several properties in parallel, and engine partitioning, based on concurrent runs of different model-checking engines competing for completion of the same problem. We investigate concurrency not only to effectively exploit several available engines, which operate independently, but also to show that a cooperative effort is possible. In this case, we adopt a straightforward, light-weight, model of inter-engine communication and data sharing. We provide a detailed description of the ideas, algorithms, and experimental results obtained on the benchmarks from the Hardware Model Checking Competition suites (HWMCC'10 and HWMCC'11)."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13330","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13330","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13331","fieldValue":" Power-transmission loss can be a severe problem for low-power embedded systems organized in a daisy-chain topology. The loss can be so high that it can result in failure to power the load in the first place. The first contribution of this article is a recursive algorithm for solving the transmission current on each segment of the daisy chain at a given supply voltage. It enables solving not only the transmission loss but also reports infeasible configurations if the voltage is too low. Using this core algorithm, our second contribution is to find energy-efficient configurations that use local energy buffers (LEBs) to eliminate peak load on the bus without relying on high voltage. Experimental results confirm that our proposed techniques significantly reduce the total energy consumption and enable the deployed system to operate for significantly longer."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13331","fieldValue":"Analysis and minimization of power-transmission loss in locally daisy-chained systems by local energy buffering"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13331","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13331","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13332","fieldValue":" This article presents a novel scheme for saving architectural power by mitigating delay degradations in digital circuits due to bias temperature instability (BTI), inspired by the notion of human circadian rhythms. The method works in two alternating phases. In the first, the compute phase, the circuit is awake and active, operating briskly at a greater-than-nominal supply voltage which causes tasks to complete more quickly. In the second, the idle phase, the circuit is power-gated and put to sleep, enabling BTI recovery. Since the wakeful stage works at an elevated supply voltage, it results in greater aging than operation at the nominal supply voltage, but the sleep state involves a recovery that more than compensates for this differential. We demonstrate, both at the circuit and the architectural levels, that at about the same performance, this approach can result in appreciable BTI mitigation, thus reducing the guardbands necessary to protect against aging, which results in power savings over the conventional design."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13332","fieldValue":"BTI"}
