Rapid advances in performance capture and advanced rendering techniques have allowed the movie industry in particular to create characters that appear very human-like. However, with these new capabilities has come the realization that such characters are yet not quite â\u20ACœright.â\u20AC? One possible hypothesis is that these virtual humans fall into an â\u20ACœUncanny Valleyâ\u20AC?, where the viewer's emotional response is repulsion or rejection, rather than the empathy or emotional engagement that their creators had hoped for. To explore these issues, we created three animated vignettes of an arguing couple with detailed motion for the face, eyes, hair, and body. In a set of perceptual experiments, we explore the relative importance of different anomalies using two different methods: a questionnaire to determine the emotional response to the full-length vignettes, with and without facial motion and audio; and a 2AFC (two alternative forced choice) task to compare the performance of a virtual â\u20ACœactorâ\u20AC? in short clips (extracts from the vignettes) depicting a range of different facial and body anomalies. We found that the facial anomalies are particularly salient, even when very significant body animation anomalies are present."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3383","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3383","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24674","fieldValue":" We analyze properties associated with a simple yet effective way to exploit parallel processors in discrete event simulations: averaging the results of multiple, independent replications that are run, in parallel, on multiple processors. We focus on estimating expectations from terminating simulations, or steady state parameters from regenerative simulations. We assume that there is a CPU time constraint, t, on each of P processors. Unless the replication lengths are bounded, one must be willing to simulate beyond any fixed, finite time t on at least some processors in order to always obtain a strongly consistent estimator (as the number of processors increases). We therefore consider simulation experiments in which t is viewed as either being a strict constraint, or a guideline, in which case simulation beyond time t is permitted. The statistical properties, including strong laws, central limit theorems, bias expansions, and completion time distributions of a variety of estimators obtainable from such an experiment are derived. We propose an unbiased estimator for a simple mean value. This estimator requires preselecting a fraction of the processors. Simulation beyond time t may be required on a preselected processor, but only if no replications have yet been completed on that processor. being a strict constraint, or a guideline, in which case simulation beyond time t is permitted.

A logical process in a self-initiating model schedules its own state reevaluation times, independently of any other logical process, and sends its new state to other logical processes following the reevaluation. Our interest is in the effects of that communication on synchronization. Using a model that idealizes the communication topology of a simulation, we consider the performance of various synchronization protocols by deriving upper and lower bounds on optimal performance, upper bounds on Time Warp's performance, and lower bounds on the performance of a new consevative protocol. Our analysis of Time Warp includes some of the overhead costs of state saving and rollback; the effects of propogating rollbacks are ignored. The analysis points out sufficient conditions for the conservitive protocol to outperform Time Warp. The analysis also quantifies the sensitivity of performance to message fanout, lookahead ability, and the probability distributions underlying the simulation."}
