{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2998","fieldValue":" Named entity recognition has served many natural language processing tasks such as information retrieval, machine translation, and question answering systems. Many researchers have addressed the name identification issue in a variety of languages and recently some research efforts have started to focus on named entity recognition for the Arabic language. We present a working Arabic information extraction (IE) system that is used to analyze large volumes of news texts every day to extract the named entity (NE) types person, organization, location, date, and number, as well as quotations (direct reported speech) by and about people. The named entity recognition (NER) system was not developed for Arabic, but instead a multilingual NER system was adapted to also cover Arabic. The Semitic language Arabic substantially differs from the Indo-European and Finno-Ugric languages currently covered. This article thus describes what Arabic language-specific resources had to be developed and what changes needed to be made to the rule set in order to be applicable to the Arabic language. The achieved evaluation results are generally satisfactory, but could be improved for certain entity types."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2998","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2998","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/20923","fieldValue":" Administrators often prefer to keep related sets of files in different locations or media, as it is easier to maintain them separately. Users, however, prefer to see all files in one location for convenience. One solution that accommodates both needs is virtual namespace unification---providing a merged view of several directories without physically merging them. For example, namespace unification can merge the contents of several CD-ROM images without unpacking them, merge binary directories from different packages, merge views from several file servers, and more. Namespace unification can also enable snapshotting by marking some data sources read-only and then utilizing copy-on-write for the read-only sources. For example, an OS image may be contained on a read-only CD-ROM image---and the user's configuration, data, and programs could be stored in a separate read-write directory. With copy-on-write unification, the user need not be concerned about the two disparate file systems.It is difficult to maintain Unix semantics while offering a versatile namespace unification system. Past efforts to provide such unification often compromised on the set of features provided or Unix compatibility---resulting in an incomplete solution that users could not use.We designed and implemented a versatile namespace unification system called Unionfs. Unionfs maintains Unix semantics while offering advanced namespace unification features: dynamic insertion and removal of namespaces at any point in the merged view, mixing read-only and read-write components, efficient in-kernel duplicate elimination, NFS interoperability, and more. Since releasing our Linux implementation, it has been used by thousands of users and over a dozen Linux distributions, which helped us discover and solve many practical problems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/20923","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/20923","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/20924","fieldValue":" In the Outsourced Database (ODB) model, entities outsource their data management needs to a third-party service provider. Such a service provider offers mechanisms for its clients to create, store, update, and access (query) their databases. This work provides mechanisms to ensure data integrity and authenticity for outsourced databases. Specifically, this article provides mechanisms that assure the querier that the query results have not been tampered with and are authentic (with respect to the actual data owner). It investigates both the security and efficiency aspects of the problem and constructs several secure and practical schemes that facilitate the integrity and authenticity of query replies while incurring low computational and communication costs."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/20924","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/20924","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/20925","fieldValue":"Long, Darrell D E"}
