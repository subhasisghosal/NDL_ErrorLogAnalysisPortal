The discrete moves from bubble to bubble enabled in these systems do not provide a good visual sense of a larger aggregate such as a whole city block. Multi-perspective \"strip\" panoramas can provide a visual summary of a city street but lack the full realism of immersive panoramas. We present Street Slide, which combines the best aspects of the immersive nature of bubbles with the overview provided by multi-perspective strip panoramas. We demonstrate a seamless transition between bubbles and multi-perspective panoramas. We also present a dynamic construction of the panoramas which overcomes many of the limitations of previous systems. As the user slides sideways, the multi-perspective panorama is constructed and rendered dynamically to simulate either a perspective or hyper-perspective view. This provides a strong sense of parallax, which adds to the immersion. We call this form of sliding sideways while looking at a street façade a street slide. Finally we integrate annotations and a mini-map within the user interface to provide geographic information as well additional affordances for navigation. We demonstrate our Street Slide system on a series of intersecting streets in an urban setting. We report the results of a user study, which shows that visual searching is greatly enhanced with the Street Slide interface over existing systems from Google and Bing."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16302","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16302","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16303","fieldValue":"Seidel, Hans-Peter"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16303","fieldValue":"Lensch, Hendrik P A"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16303","fieldValue":" In fluorescent materials, light from a certain band of incident wavelengths is reradiated at longer wavelengths, i.e., with a reduced per-photon energy. While fluorescent materials are common in everyday life, they have received little attention in computer graphics. Especially, no bidirectional reradiation measurements of fluorescent materials have been available so far. In this paper, we extend the well-known concept of the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) to account for energy transfer between wavelengths, resulting in a Bispectral Bidirectional Reflectance and Reradiation Distribution Function (bispectral BRRDF). Using a bidirectional and bispectral measurement setup, we acquire reflectance and reradiation data of a variety of fluorescent materials, including vehicle paints, paper and fabric, and compare their renderings with RGB, RGBxRGB, and spectral BRDFs. Our acquisition is guided by a principal component analysis on complete bispectral data taken under a sparse set of angles. We show that in order to faithfully reproduce the full bispectral information for all other angles, only a very small number of wavelength pairs needs to be measured at a high angular resolution."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16303","fieldValue":"Acquisition and analysis of bispectral bidirectional reflectance and reradiation distribution functions"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16303","fieldValue":"ACM"}
