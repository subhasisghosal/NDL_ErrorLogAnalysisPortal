The merit of these methods is often judged by assessing the quality of a set of results through lengthy user studies. We present a full-reference video quality metric geared specifically towards the requirements of Computer Graphics applications as a faster computational alternative to subjective evaluation. Our metric can compare a video pair with arbitrary dynamic ranges, and comprises a human visual system model for a wide range of luminance levels, that predicts distortion visibility through models of luminance adaptation, spatiotemporal contrast sensitivity and visual masking. We present applications of the proposed metric to quality prediction of HDR video compression and temporal tone mapping, comparison of different rendering approaches and qualities, and assessing the impact of variable frame rate to perceived quality."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16374","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16374","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16375","fieldValue":" We present a novel method for surface reflectometry from a few observations of a scene under a single uniform spherical field of circularly polarized illumination. The method is based on a novel analysis of the Stokes reflectance field of circularly polarized spherical illumination and yields per-pixel estimates of diffuse albedo, specular albedo, index of refraction, and specular roughness of isotropic BRDFs. To infer these reflectance parameters, we measure the Stokes parameters of the reflected light at each pixel by taking four photographs of the scene, consisting of three photographs with differently oriented linear polarizers in front of the camera, and one additional photograph with a circular polarizer. The method only assumes knowledge of surface orientation, for which we make a few additional photometric measurements. We verify our method with three different lighting setups, ranging from specialized to off-the-shelf hardware, which project either discrete or continuous fields of spherical illumination. Our technique offers several benefits: it estimates a more detailed model of per-pixel surface reflectance parameters than previous work, it requires a relatively small number of measurements, it is applicable to a wide range of material types, and it is completely viewpoint independent."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16375","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16375","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2552","fieldValue":" Spanner of an undirected graph G = (V,E) is a subgraph that is sparse and yet preserves all-pairs distances approximately. More formally, a spanner with stretch t âˆˆ &Nopf; is a subgraph $(V,E_S), ES$ âŠ\u2020 E such that the distance between any two vertices in the subgraph is at most t times their distance in G. Though G is trivially a t-spanner of itself, the research as well as applications of spanners invariably deal with a t-spanner that has as small number of edges as possible. We present fully dynamic algorithms for maintaining spanners in centralized as well as synchronized distributed environments. These algorithms are designed for undirected unweighted graphs and use randomization in a crucial manner. Our algorithms significantly improve the existing fully dynamic algorithms for graph spanners. The expected size (number of edges) of a t-spanner maintained at each stage by our algorithms matches, up to a polylogarithmic factor, the worst case optimal size of a t-spanner. The expected amortized time (or messages communicated in distributed environment) to process a single insertion\/deletion of an edge by our algorithms is close to optimal."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2552","fieldValue":"ACM"}
