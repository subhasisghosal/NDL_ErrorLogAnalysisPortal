An omnistereo projection on a cylindrical display does not require tracking of the observer's viewing direction. However, such a display introduces stereo distortions. In this article, we investigate two projection models for rendering 3D scenes in omnistereo. The first is designed to give zero disparity errors at the center of the visual field. The second is the well-known slit-camera model. For both models, disparity errors are shown to increase gradually in the periphery, as visual stereo acuity decreases. We use available data on human stereoscopic acuity limits to argue that depth distortions caused by these models are so small that they cannot be perceived."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3386","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3386","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24698","fieldValue":" In this paper we propose a new approach to parallel and distributed simulation of discrete event systems. Most parallel and distributed discrete event simulation algorithms are concerned with the simulation of one â\u20ACœlargeâ\u20AC? discrete event system. In this case the computational intensity is due to the size and complexity of the simulated system. In contrast, we are interested in simulating a â\u20ACœlargeâ\u20AC? number of â\u20ACœmedium sizedâ\u20AC? systems. These are variants of a â\u20ACœnominal systemâ\u20AC? with different system parameter values or operation policies. The computational intensity in our case is due to the â\u20ACœlargeâ\u20AC? number of simulated variants. Many simulation projects such as factor screening, performance modeling, and optimization require system performance evaluations at many parameter values; and others, we believe, could significantly benefit from them.There is considerable work in the literature on stochastic coupling of trajectories of parametric families of stochastic processes. Our approach can be viewed as the simulation of the coupled trajectories. We use a single clock mechanism that drives all trajectories simultaneously, hence the approach is called Single Clock Multiple System (SCMS) simulation. The single clock synchronizes all trajectories such that the â\u20ACœsameâ\u20AC? event occurs at the â\u20ACœsameâ\u20AC? time at all systems. This synchronization is the basis of our parallel and distributed algorithms.We focus on a particular implementation of the SCMS simulation using the so-called Standard Clock (SC) technique and also on the massively parallel implementation of the SC algorithms on the SIMD Connection Machine. Orders of magnitude of speedup is possible. Furthermore, the possibility of concurrent performance evaluation and comparison at many system parameter values offers new and significant opportunities for performance optimization."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24698","fieldValue":"Massively parallel and distributed simulation of a class of discrete event systems: a different perspective"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24698","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24698","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24699","fieldValue":"Lin, Yi-Bing"}
