{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14985","fieldValue":" Stochastic techniques have assumed a prominent role in computer graphics because of their success in modeling a variety of complex and natural phenomena. This paper describes the basis for techniques such as stochastic subdivision in the theory of random processes and estimation theory. The popular stochastic subdivision construction is then generalized to provide control of the autocorrelation and spectral properties of the synthesized random functions. The generalized construction is suitable for generating a variety of perceptually distinct high-quality random functions, including those with non-fractal spectra and directional or oscillatory characteristics. It is argued that a spectral modeling approach provides a more powerful and somewhat more intuitive perceptual characterization of random processes than does the fractal model. Synthetic textures and terrains are presented as a means of visually evaluating the generalized subdivision technique."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14985","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14985","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14986","fieldValue":" The graphical simulation of a certain subset of hydrodynamics phenomena is examined. New algorithms for both modeling and rendering these complex phenomena are presented.The modeling algorithms deal with wave refraction in an ocean. Waves refract in much the same way as light. In both cases, the equation that controls the change in direction is Snell's law. Ocean waves are continuous but can be discretely decomposed into wave rays or wave orthogonals. These wave orthogonals are wave-traced in a manner similar to the rendering algorithm of ray-tracing. The refracted wave orthogonals are later traversed and their height contributions to the final surface are calculated using a sinusoidal shape approximation and the principle of wave superposition. The surface is then represented by Beta-splines, using the tension (or Î²2) shape parameter to easily add more complexity to the surface.The rendering algorithms are based on the use of texture maps and Fresnel's law of reflection. In each algorithm, two texture maps are used to simulate reflection and refraction. Based on surface normal orientation and Fresnel's law, a weighting is calculated that determines what fractions of reflected color and refracted color are assigned to a point. These algorithms are more efficient, though less accurate, alternatives to standard ray-tracing techniques."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14986","fieldValue":"Modeling and rendering waves: wave-tracing using beta-splines and reflective and refractive texture mapping."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14986","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14986","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14987","fieldValue":" The interaction of light with particles suspended in the air is the cause of some beautiful effects. Among these effects are the colors of the sunset, the blue of the sky, and the appearance of a scene in fog. A lighting model that takes into account the effects of scattering by suspended particles is presented. A method of computing the colors of the sun and sky, for any sun position above the horizon, is derived from the lighting model. The model is also suitable for rendering fog under general lighting conditions. As an example of the use of the model for rendering fog, the special case of fog lit by the sun, without shadows, is considered."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14987","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14987","fieldValue":"ACM"}
