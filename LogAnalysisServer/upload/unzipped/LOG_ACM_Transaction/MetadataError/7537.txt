We further assume that each wireless node can transmit (or receive) at W bits\/second over a common wireless channel. For each node vi, we randomly and independently pick k-1 points pi,j (1 â\u2030¤ j â\u2030¤ k-1) from the square, and then multicast data to the nearest node for each pi,j. We derive matching asymptotic upper bounds and lower bounds on multicast capacity of random wireless networks. Under protocol interference model, when $a2\/r^2$ = O(n\/log(n)), we show that the total multicast capacity is Î˜ (âˆšn\/log n Ä\u2039 (W\/âˆšk)) when k = O(n\/log n); the total multicast capacity is Î˜ (W) when k = Î©(n\/log n). We also study the capacity of group-multicast for wireless networks where for each source node, we randomly select k - 1 groups of nodes as receivers and the nodes in each group are within a constant hops from the group leader. The same asymptotic upper bounds and lower bounds still hold. We also extend our capacity bounds to d-dimensional networks."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9882","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9882","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9882","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/9883","fieldValue":"Lai, Yuan-Cheng"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/9883","fieldValue":"Lin, Chih-Chung"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9883","fieldValue":" In radio frequency identification (RFID) systems, the reader identifies tags through communication over a shared wireless channel. When multiple tags transmit their IDs simultaneously, their signals collide, increasing the identification delay. Therefore, many previous anti-collision algorithms, including an adaptive query splitting algorithm (AQS) and an adaptive binary splitting algorithm (ABS), focused on solving this problem. This paper proposes two blocking algorithms, a single resolution blocking ABS algorithm (SRB) and a pair resolution blocking ABS algorithm (PRB), based on ABS. SRB not only inherits the essence of ABS which uses the information of recognized tags obtained from the last process of tag identification, but also adopts a blocking technique which prevents recognized tags from being collided by unrecognized tags. PRB further adopts a pair resolution technique which couples recognized tags and thus only needs half time for next identifying these recognized tags. We formally analyze the performance of SRB and PRB. Finally, the analytic and simulation results show that SRB slightly outperforms ABS and PRB significantly surpasses ABS."}
