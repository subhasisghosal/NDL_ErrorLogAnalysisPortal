Our problem becomes identifying a small conductance subgraph containing many (but not necessarily all) members of the given seed set. Starting with an initial seed set representing a sample of a community, we seek to discover as much of the full community as possible. We present a general method for network community expansion, demonstrating that our methods work well in expanding communities in real world networks starting from small given seed groups (20 to 400 members). Our approach is marked by incremental expansion from the seeds with retrospective analysis to determine the ultimate boundaries of our community. We demonstrate how to increase the robustness of the general approach through bootstrapping multiple random partitions of the input set into seed and evaluation groups. We go beyond statistical comparisons against gold standards to careful subjective evaluations of our expanded communities. This process explains the causes of most disagreement between our expanded communities and our gold-standardsâ\u20AC\u201Darguing that our expansion methods provide more reliable communities than can be extracted from reference sources\/gazetteers such as Wikipedia."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7863","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7863","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7864","fieldValue":"Lin, Yu-Ru"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7864","fieldValue":" We discover communities from social network data and analyze the community evolution. These communities are inherent characteristics of human interaction in online social networks, as well as paper citation networks. Also, communities may evolve over time, due to changes to individuals' roles and social status in the network as well as changes to individuals' research interests. We present an innovative algorithm that deviates from the traditional two-step approach to analyze community evolutions. In the traditional approach, communities are first detected for each time slice, and then compared to determine correspondences. We argue that this approach is inappropriate in applications with noisy data. In this paper, we propose FacetNet for analyzing communities and their evolutions through a robust unified process. This novel framework will discover communities and capture their evolution with temporal smoothness given by historic community structures. Our approach relies on formulating the problem in terms of maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation, where the community structure is estimated both by the observed networked data and by the prior distribution given by historic community structures. Then we develop an iterative algorithm, with proven low time complexity, which is guaranteed to converge to an optimal solution. We perform extensive experimental studies, on both synthetic datasets and real datasets, to demonstrate that our method discovers meaningful communities and provides additional insights not directly obtainable from traditional methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7864","fieldValue":"ACM"}
