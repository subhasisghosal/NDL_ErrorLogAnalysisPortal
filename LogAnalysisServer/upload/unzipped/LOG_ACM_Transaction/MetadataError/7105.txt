A general theory for all graphs, hence including the graph representation of the Internet, is presented which quantifies the multicast reduction in network links compared to m times unicast. For two special types of graphs, the random graph Gp(N) and the k-ary tree, exact and asymptotic results are derived. Comparing these explicit results with previously published Internet measurements [13] indicates that the number of routers in the Internet that can be reached from a root grows exponentially in the number of hops with an effective degree of approximately 3.2."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9037","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/9037","fieldValue":"<i>k<\/i>-ary tree"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_LOWER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9037","fieldValue":"<i>k<\/i>-ary tree"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9037","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9037","fieldValue":"ACM"}
