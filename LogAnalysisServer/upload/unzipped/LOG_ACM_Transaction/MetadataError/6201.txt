The proposed multiplier has a significantly higher speed, compared to previously proposed word-level architectures using either redundant representation or optimal normal basis type I, at the expense of moderately higher area complexity. Furthermore, the new design out-performs other similar proposals when considering the product of area and delay as a measure of performance. ASIC Realization of the proposed design using TSMCâ\u20AC™s .18 um CMOS technology for the binary field size of 163 is also presented."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6538","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6538","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6539","fieldValue":"Leyva-del-Foyo, Luis E"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6539","fieldValue":"Mejia-Alvarez, Pedro"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6539","fieldValue":"de Niz, Dionisio"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6539","fieldValue":" Real-time scheduling algorithms like RMA or EDF and their corresponding schedulability test have proven to be powerful tools for developing predictable real-time systems. However, the traditional interrupt management model presents multiple inconsistencies that break the assumptions of many of the real-time scheduling tests, diminishing its utility. In this article, we analyze these inconsistencies and present a model that resolves them by integrating interrupts and tasks in a single scheduling model. We then use the RMA theory to calculate the cost of the model and analyze the circumstances under which it can provide the most value. This model was implemented in a kernel module. The portability of the design of our module is discussed in terms of its independence from both the hardware and the kernel. We also discuss the implementation issues of the model over conventional PC hardware, along with its cost and novel optimizations for reducing the overhead. Finally, we present our experimental evaluation to show evidence of its temporal determinism and overhead."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6539","fieldValue":"ACM"}
