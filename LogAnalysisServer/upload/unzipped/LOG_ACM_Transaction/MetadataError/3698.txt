This article describes the Table-Hadamard generator, which is a GRNG designed to generate multiple streams of random numbers in parallel. It uses discrete table distributions to generate pseudo-Gaussian base samples, then a parallel Hadamard transform to efficiently apply the central limit theorem. When generating 64 output samples, the Table-Hadamard requires just 130 slices per generated sample, which is a third of the resources needed by the next best technique, while still providing higher statistical quality."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21911","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21911","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21912","fieldValue":"Bakos, Jason D"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21912","fieldValue":" Massively parallel memory systems are designed to deliver high bandwidth at relatively low clock speed for memory-intensive applications implemented on programmable logic. For example, the Convey HC-1 provides 1,024 DRAM banks to each of four FPGAs through a full crossbar, presenting a peak bandwidth of 76.8GB\/s to the user logic. Such highly parallel memory systems suffer from high latency, and their effective bandwidth is highly sensitive to access ordering. To achieve high performance, the user must use a customized memory interface that combines scheduling, latency hiding, and data reuse. In this article, we describe the design of a custom memory interface for 3D stencil kernels on the Convey HC-1 that incorporates these features. Experimental results show that the proposed memory interface achieves a speedup in runtime of 2.2 for 6-point stencil and 9.5 for 27-point stencil when compared to a naive memory interface."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21912","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21912","fieldValue":"ACM"}
