Conventional approaches are limited in two aspects. The first factor is the de-emphasized role of semantic content that is many times more important than low-level features in photo aesthetics. Second is the importance of image spatial modeling: toward a semantically reasonable retargeted photo, the spatial distribution of objects within an image should be accurately learned. To solve these two problems, we propose a new semantically aware photo retargeting that shrinks a photo according to region semantics. The key technique is a mechanism transferring semantics of noisy image labels (inaccurate labels predicted by a learner like an SVM) into different image regions. In particular, we first project the local aesthetic features (graphlets in this work) onto a semantic space, wherein image labels are selectively encoded according to their noise level. Then, a category-sharing model is proposed to robustly discover the semantics of each image region. The model is motivated by the observation that the semantic distribution of graphlets from images tagged by a common label remains stable in the presence of noisy labels. Thereafter, a spatial pyramid is constructed to hierarchically encode the spatial layout of graphlet semantics. Based on this, a probabilistic model is proposed to enforce the spatial layout of a retargeted photo to be maximally similar to those from the training photos. Experimental results show that (1) noisy image labels predicted by different learners can improve the retargeting performance, according to both qualitative and quantitative analysis, and (2) the category-sharing model stays stable even when 32.36&percnt; of image labels are incorrectly predicted."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25736","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25736","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25737","fieldValue":" As video traffic has dominated the data flow of smartphones, traditional cellular communications face substantial transmission challenges. In this work, we study mobile device-to-device (D2D) video distribution that leverages the storage and communication capacities of smartphones. In such a mobile distributed framework, D2D communication represents an opportunistic process to selectively store and transmit local videos to meet the future demand of others. The performance is measured by the service time, which denotes the elapsed period for fulfilling the demand, and the corresponding implementation of each device depends on the videoâ\u20AC™s demand, availability, and size. The main contributions of this work lie in (1) considering the impact of video size in a practical mobile D2D video distribution scenario and proposing a general global estimation of the video distribution based on limited and local observations; (2) designing a purely distributed D2D video distribution scheme without the monitoring of any central controller; and (3) providing a practical implementation of the scheme, which does not need to know the video availability, user demand, and device mobility. Numerical results have demonstrated the efficiency and robustness of the proposed scheme."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25737","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25737","fieldValue":"ACM"}
