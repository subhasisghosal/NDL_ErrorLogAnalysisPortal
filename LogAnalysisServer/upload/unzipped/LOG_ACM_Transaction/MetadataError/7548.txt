ABVCap assigns each node multiple 5-tuple virtual coordinates. Subsequently, we introduce a protocol, ABVCap routing, to route packets based on the ABVCap virtual coordinate system. ABVCap routing guarantees packet delivery without the computation and storage of the global topological features. Finally, we demonstrate an approach, ABVCap maintenance, to reconstruct an ABVCap virtual coordinate system in a network with node failures. Simulations show ABVCap routing ensures moderate routing path length, as compared to virtual-coordinate-based routing, GLIDER, Hop ID, GLDR, and VCap."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9903","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9903","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9903","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9904","fieldValue":" We use a constrained optimization framework to derive scaling laws for data-centric storage and querying in wireless sensor networks. We consider both unstructured sensor networks, which use blind sequential search for querying, and structured sensor networks, which use efficient hash-based querying. We find that the scalability of a sensor network's performance depends upon whether the increase in energy and storage resources with more nodes is outweighed by the concomitant application-specific increase in event and query loads. We derive conditions that determine: 1) whether the energy requirement per node grows without bound with the network size for a fixed-duration deployment, 2) whether there exists a maximum network size that can be operated for a specified duration on a fixed energy budget, and 3) whether the network lifetime increases or decreases with the size of the network for a fixed energy budget. An interesting finding of this work is that three-dimensional (3D) uniform deployments are inherently more scalable than two-dimensional (2D) uniform deployments, which in turn are more scalable than one-dimensional (1D) uniform deployments."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9904","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
