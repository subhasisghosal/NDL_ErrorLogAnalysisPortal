We first define the critical causal order relation among the events. Then, we propose some mechanisms to enhance the prevalent RO (receive order delivery) mechanism in DVEs so that the real-time property of DVEs is preserved while the critical causal order violations are reduced. These mechanisms are implemented as a middleware. Experimental results show that the middleware performs well in reducing the critical causality violations in simulation and incurs little processing overhead."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25283","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25283","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25284","fieldValue":" Fast and accurate recognition of motion data streams from gesture sensing and motion capture devices has many applications and is the focus of this article. Based on the analysis of the geometric structures revealed by singular value decompositions (SVD) of motion data, a similarity measure is proposed for simultaneously segmenting and recognizing motion streams. A direction identification approach is explored to further differentiate motions with similar data geometric structures. Experiments show that the proposed similarity measure can segment and recognize motion streams of variable lengths with high accuracy, without knowing beforehand the number of motions in a stream."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25284","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25284","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25285","fieldValue":"Mayer-Patel, Ketan"}
