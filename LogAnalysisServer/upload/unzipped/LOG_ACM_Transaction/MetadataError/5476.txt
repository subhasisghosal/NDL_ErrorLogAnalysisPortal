In an effort to help identify relevant PPI publications, text-mining tools, from the machine learning discipline, can be applied to help in this process. Here, we describe and evaluate two document classification algorithms that we submitted to the BioCreative II.5 PPI Classification Challenge Task. This task asked participants to design classifiers for identifying documents containing PPI-related information in the primary literature, and evaluated them against one another. One of our systems was the overall best-performing system submitted to the challenge task. It utilizes a novel approach to k-nearest neighbor classification, which we describe here, and compare its performance to those of two support vector machine-based classification systems, one of which was also evaluated in the challenge task."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4716","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4716","fieldValue":"Protein-protein interaction, k-nearest neighbor, information gain, support vector machine, text classification."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4716","fieldValue":"k-Information Gain Scaled Nearest Neighbors: A Novel Approach to Classifying Protein-Protein Interaction-Related Documents"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4716","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4716","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4717","fieldValue":" The rapid growth of scientific literature calls for automatic and efficient ways to facilitate extracting experimental data on protein phosphorylation. Such information is of great value for biologists in studying cellular processes and diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Existing approaches like RLIMS-P are mainly rule based. The performance lays much reliance on the completeness of rules. We propose an SVM-based system known as MinePhos which outperforms RLIMS-P in both precision and recall of information extraction when tested on a set of articles randomly chosen from PubMed."}
