Diminished energy dissipation leads to a longer battery life, while reduced temperature hotspots decelerate the physical failure mechanisms. The instruction fetch logic associated with register access has a significant contribution towards the total energy consumption. Meanwhile, the register file has also been previously shown to exhibit the highest temperature compared to the rest of the components in an embedded processor. Therefore, the optimization of energy and the resolution of the thermal issue for register accesses are of great significance. In this article, register allocation techniques are studied to simultaneously reduce energy consumption and heat buildup on register accesses for embedded systems. Contrary to prevailing intuition, we observe that optimizing energy and optimizing temperature on register accesses conflict with each other. We introduce a rotator hardware in the instruction decoder to facilitate a balanced solution for the two conflicting objectives. Algorithms for register allocation and refinement are proposed based on the access patterns and the effects of the rotator. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms obtain notable improvements of energy and peak temperature for embedded applications."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6758","fieldValue":"Register allocation for embedded systems to simultaneously reduce energy and temperature on registers"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6758","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6758","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6759","fieldValue":"Gordon-Ross, Ann"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6759","fieldValue":" The commercialization of sensor-based platforms is facilitating the realization of numerous sensor network applications with diverse application requirements. However, sensor network platforms are becoming increasingly complex to design and optimize due to the multitude of interdependent parameters that must be considered. To further complicate matters, application experts oftentimes are not trained engineers, but rather biologists, teachers, or agriculturists who wish to utilize the sensor-based platforms for various domain-specific tasks. To assist both platform developers and application experts, we present a centralized dynamic profiling and optimization platform for sensor-based systems that enables application experts to rapidly optimize a sensor network for a particular application without requiring extensive knowledge of, and experience with, the underlying physical hardware platform. In this article, we present an optimization framework that allows developers to characterize application requirements through high-level design metrics and fuzzy-logic-based optimization. We further analyze the benefits of utilizing dynamic profiling information to eliminate the guesswork of creating a â\u20ACœgoodâ\u20AC? benchmark, present several reoptimization evaluation algorithms used to detect if re-optimization is necessary, and highlight the benefits of the proposed dynamic optimization framework compared to static optimization alternatives."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6759","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6759","fieldValue":"ACM"}
