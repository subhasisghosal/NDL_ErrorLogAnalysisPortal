However, providing delay guarantees to time-sensitive traffic in such a network is challenging because its transmission capacity is variable even in the absence of any channel impairment. We propose and evaluate the performance of a novel transmission scheduling scheme that is capable of providing such a delay guarantee in a MultiCode-CDMA network. The proposed scheme drops packets to ensure that delays for all transmitted packets are within the guaranteed target bounds, but packets are dropped in a controlled manner such that the average dropping ratios of a set of time-sensitive flows can be proportionally differentiated according to the assigned weighting factors or shares. We provide extensive simulation results to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme as well as to study the effects of various parameters on its performance. In particular, we show that it can simultaneously guarantee a delay upper bound and a proportionally differentiated dropping ratio in a fading wireless channel for different traffic loads, peak transmission rates, and weighting factors of individual flows."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9216","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9216","fieldValue":"A novel scheduling scheme to share dropping ratio while guaranteeing a delay bound in a multiCode-CDMA network"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9216","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9216","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8354","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9217","fieldValue":" Knowledge of the up-to-date physical topology of an IP network is crucial to a number of critical network management tasks, including reactive and proactive resource management, event correlation, and root-cause analysis. Given the dynamic nature of today's IP networks, keeping track of topology information manually is a daunting (if not impossible) task. Thus, effective algorithms for automatically discovering physical network topology are necessary. Earlier work has typically concentrated on either 1) discovering logical (i.e., layer-3) topology, which implies that the connectivity of all layer-2 elements (e.g., switches and bridges) is ignored, or 2) proprietary solutions targeting specific product families. In this paper, we present novel algorithms for discovering physical topology in heterogeneous (i.e., multi-vendor) IP networks. Our algorithms rely on standard SNMP MIB information that is widely supported by modern IP network elements and require no modifications to the operating system software running on elements or hosts. We have implemented the algorithms presented in this paper in the context of the NetInventory topology-discovery tool that has been tested on Lucent's own research network. The experimental results clearly validate our approach, demonstrating that our tool can consistently discover the accurate physical network topology with reasonably small running-time requirements even for fairly large network configurations."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9217","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9217","fieldValue":"ACM"}
