Given a 3D object and a stacking direction, we define a measure of stackability, which is derived from the gap between the lower and upper envelopes of the object in a stacking configuration along the stacking direction. The main challenge in stackabilization lies in the desire to modify the object's geometry only subtly so that the intended functionality and aesthetic appearance of the original object are not significantly affected. We present an automatic algorithm to deform a 3D object to meet a target stackability score using energy minimization. The optimized energy accounts for both the scales of the deformation parameters as well as the preservation of pre-existing geometric and structural properties in the object, e. g., symmetry, as a means of maintaining its functionality. We also present an intelligent editing tool that assists a modeler when modifying a given 3D object to improve its stackability. Finally, we explore a few fun variations of the stackabilization problem."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16747","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16747","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16748","fieldValue":" In the design of buildings, structural analysis is traditionally performed after the aesthetic design has been determined and has little influence on the overall form. In contrast, this paper presents an approach to guide the form towards a shape that is more structurally sound. Our work is centered on the study of how variations of the geometry might improve structural stability. We define a new measure of structural soundness for masonry buildings as well as cables, and derive its closed-form derivative with respect to the displacement of all the vertices describing the geometry. We start with a gradient descent tool which displaces each vertex along the gradient. We then introduce displacement operators, imposing constraints such as the preservation of orientation or thickness; or setting additional objectives such as volume minimization."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16748","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16748","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16749","fieldValue":" We present a novel approach for real-time rendering of static 3D models front-to-back or back-to-front relative to any viewpoint outside its bounding volume. The approach renders depth-sorted triangles using a single draw-call. At run-time, we replace the traditional sorting strategy of existing algorithms with a faster triangle selection strategy. The selection process operates on an extended sequence of triangles annotated by test planes, created by our off-line preprocessing stage. Based on these test planes, a simple run-time procedure uses the given viewpoint to select a subsequence of triangles for rasterization. Selected subsequences are statically presorted by depth and contain each input triangle exactly once. Our method runs on legacy hardware and renders depth-sorted static models significantly faster than previous approaches. We conclude demonstrating the real-time rendering of order-independent transparency effects."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16749","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16749","fieldValue":"ACM"}
