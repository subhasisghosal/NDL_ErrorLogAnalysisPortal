The United States Congress is considering legislation on net neutrality, and debate over the issue has generated intense lobbying. Congressional action will substantially affect the evolution of the Internet and of future Internet research. In this article, we argue that neither the pro nor anti net neutrality positions are consistent with the philosophy of Internet architecture. We develop a net neutrality policy founded on a segmentation of Internet services into infrastructure services and application services, based on the Internet's layered architecture. Our net neutrality policy restricts an Internet service Provider's ability to engage in anticompetitive behavior while simultaneously ensuring that it can use desirable forms of network management. We illustrate the effect of this policy by discussing acceptable and unacceptable uses of network management."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24394","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24394","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24395","fieldValue":" IP source address spoofing has plagued the Internet for many years.

It evaluates data from the Spoofer Project, and describes and analyzes host-based defense methods, router-based defense methods, and their combinations. It further analyzes what obstacles stand in the way of deploying those modern solutions and what areas require further research."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24395","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24395","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24396","fieldValue":" We propose a framework for querying heterogeneous XML data sources. The framework ensures high autonomy to participating sources as it does not rely on a global schema or on semantic mappings between schemas. The basic intuition is that of extending traditional approaches for approximate query evaluation, by providing techniques for combining partial answers coming from different sources, possibly on the basis of limited knowledge about the local schemas (i.e., key constraints). We define a query language and its associated semantics, that allows us to collect as much information as possible from several heterogeneous XML sources. We provide algorithms for query evaluation and characterize the complexity of the query language. Finally, we validate the approach in a medical application scenario."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24396","fieldValue":"XML"}
