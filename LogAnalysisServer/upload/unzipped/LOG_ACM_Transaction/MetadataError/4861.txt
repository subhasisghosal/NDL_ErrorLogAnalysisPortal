{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3472","fieldValue":" In this article, a new hypothesis on facial beauty perception is proposed: the weighted average of two facial geometric features is more attractive than the inferior one between them. Extensive evidences support the new hypothesis. We collected 390 well-known beautiful face images (e.g., Miss Universe, movie stars, and super models) as well as 409 common face images from multiple sources. Dozens of volunteers rated the face images according to their attractiveness. Statistical regression models are trained on this database. Under the empirical risk principle, the hypothesis is tested on 318,801 pairs of images and receives consistently supportive results. A corollary of the hypothesis is attractive facial geometric features construct a convex set. This corollary derives a convex hull based face beautification method, which guarantees attractiveness and minimizes the before--after difference. Experimental results show its superiority to state-of-the-art geometric based face beautification methods. Moreover, the mainstream hypotheses on facial beauty perception (e.g., the averageness, symmetry, and golden ratio hypotheses) are proved to be compatible with the proposed hypothesis."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3472","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3472","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25616","fieldValue":" Online galleries of 3D models typically provide two ways to preview a model before the model is downloaded and viewed by the user: (i) by showing a set of thumbnail images of the 3D model taken from representative views (or keyviews); (ii) by showing a video of the 3D model as viewed from a moving virtual camera along a path determined by the content provider. We propose a third approach called preview streaming for mesh-based 3D objects: by streaming and showing parts of the mesh surfaces visible along the virtual camera path. This article focuses on the preview streaming architecture and framework and presents our investigation into how such a system would best handle network congestion effectively. We present three basic methods: (a) stop-and-wait, where the camera pauses until sufficient data is buffered; (b) reduce-speed, where the camera slows down in accordance to reduce network bandwidth; and (c) reduce-quality, where the camera continues to move at the same speed but fewer vertices are sent and displayed, leading to lower mesh quality. We further propose two advanced methods: (d) keyview-aware, which trades off mesh quality and camera speed appropriately depending on how close the current view is to the keyviews, and (e) adaptive-zoom, which improves visual quality by moving the virtual camera away from the original path. A user study reveals that our keyview-aware method is preferred over the basic methods. Moreover, the adaptive-zoom scheme compares favorably to the keyview-aware method, showing that path adaptation is a viable approach to handling bandwidth variation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25616","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25616","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25617","fieldValue":"Landsverk, stein"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25617","fieldValue":" The importance of winning has increased the role of performance analysis in the sports industry, and this underscores how statistics and technology keep changing the way sports are played. Thus, this is a growing area of interest, both from a computer system view in managing the technical challenges and from a sport performance view in aiding the development of athletes. In this respect, Bagadus is a real-time prototype of a sports analytics application using soccer as a case study. Bagadus integrates a sensor system, a soccer analytics annotations system, and a video processing system using a video camera array. A prototype is currently installed at Alfheim Stadium in Norway, and in this article, we describe how the system can be used in real-time to playback events. The system supports both stitched panorama video and camera switching modes and creates video summaries based on queries to the sensor system. Moreover, we evaluate the system from a systems point of view, benchmarking different approaches, algorithms, and trade-offs, and show how the system runs in real time."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25617","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25617","fieldValue":"ACM"}
