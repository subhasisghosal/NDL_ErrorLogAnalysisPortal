{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6265","fieldValue":" This paper provides an analysis of embedded systems education using a didactic approach. Didactics is a field of educational studies mostly referring to research aimed at investigating what's unique with a particular subject and how this subject ought to be taught. From the analysis we conclude that embedded systems has a thematic identity and a functional legitimacy. This implies that the subject would benefit from being taught with an exemplifying selection and using an interactive communication, meaning that the education should move from teaching â\u20ACœsomething of everythingâ\u20AC? toward â\u20ACœeverything of something.â\u20AC? The interactive communication aims at adapting the education toward the individual student, which is feasible if using educational methods inspired by project-organized and problem-based learning. This educational setting is also advantageous as it prepares the students for a future career as embedded system engineers. The conclusions drawn from the analysis correlate with our own experiences from education in mechatronics as well as with a recently published study of 21 companies in Sweden dealing with industrial software engineering."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6265","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6265","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1521","fieldValue":" The recent miniaturization of cameras has enabled finger-based reading approaches that provide blind and visually impaired readers with access to printed materials. Compared to handheld text scanners such as mobile phone applications, mounting a tiny camera on the user's own finger has the potential to mitigate camera framing issues, enable a blind reader to better understand the spatial layout of a document, and provide better control over reading pace. A finger-based approach, however, also introduces the need to guide the reader in physically navigating a document, such as tracing along lines of text. While previous work has proposed audio and haptic directional finger guidance for this purpose, user studies of finger-based reading have not provided an in-depth performance analysis of the finger-based reading process. To further investigate the effectiveness of finger-based sensing and feedback for reading printed text, we conducted a controlled laboratory experiment with 19 blind participants, comparing audio and haptic directional finger guidance within an iPad-based testbed. As a small follow-up, we asked four of those participants to return and provide feedback on a preliminary wearable prototype called HandSight. Findings from the controlled experiment show similar performance between haptic and audio directional guidance, although audio may offer an accuracy advantage for tracing lines of text. Subjective feedback also highlights trade-offs between the two types of guidance, such as the interference of audio guidance with speech output and the potential for desensitization to haptic guidance. While several participants appreciated the direct access to layout information provided by finger-based exploration, important concerns also arose about ease of use and the amount of concentration required. We close with a discussion on the effectiveness of finger-based reading for blind users and potential design improvements to the HandSight prototype."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/1521","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: Atlanta VA R&#x38;D Center for Visual and Neurocognitive Rehabilitation, Decatur, GA (Ross, David A.); University of Maryland, College Park, MD (Stearns, Lee; Du, Ruofei; Oh, Uran; Jou, Catherine; Findlater, Leah; Froehlich, Jon E.)"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1521","fieldValue":"Evaluating Haptic and Auditory Directional Guidance to Assist Blind People in Reading Printed Text Using Finger-Mounted Cameras"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1521","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1521","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6266","fieldValue":" Silicon technology advances have made it possible to pack millions of transistors---switching at high clock speeds---on a single chip. While these advances bring unprecedented performance to electronic products, they also pose difficult power\/energy consumption problems. For example, large number of transistors in dense on-chip cache memories consume significant static (leakage) power even if the cache is not used by the current computation. While previous compiler research studied code and data restructuring for improving data cache performance, to our knowledge, there exists no compiler-based study that targets data cache leakage power consumption. In this paper, we present code restructuring techniques for array-based and pointer-intensive applications for reducing data cache leakage energy consumption. The idea is to let the compiler analyze the application code and insert instructions that turn off cache lines that keep variables not used by the current computation. This turning-off does not destroy contents of a cache line and waking up the cache line (when it is accessed later) does not incur much overhead. Due to inherent data locality in applications, we find that, at a given time, only a small portion of the data cache needs to be active; the remaining part can be placed into a leakage-saving mode (state); i.e., they can be turned off. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed compiler-based strategy reduces the cache energy consumption significantly. We also demonstrate how different compiler optimizations can increase the effectiveness of our strategy."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6266","fieldValue":"ACM"}
