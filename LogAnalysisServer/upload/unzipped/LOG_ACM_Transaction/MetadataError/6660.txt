It must be large enough to accommodate the results of all in-flight instructions. It must also have enough ports to allow simultaneous issue and writeback of many values each cycle. However, this makes it one of the most energy-consuming structures within the processor with a high access latency. As technology scales, there comes a point where register accesses are the bottleneck to performance and so must be pipelined over several cycles. This increases the pipeline depth, lowering performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel use of compiler analysis to aid register caching. Adding a register cache allows us to preserve single-cycle register accesses, maintaining performance and reducing energy consumption. We do this by passing information to the processor using free bits in a real ISA, allowing us to cache only the most important registers. Evaluating the register cache over a variety of sizes and associativities and varying the read ports into the cache, our best scheme achieves an energy-delay-squared (EDD) product of 0.81, with a performance increase of 11&percnt;. Another configuration saves 13&percnt; of register system energy. Using four register cache read ports brings both performance gains and energy savings, consistently outperforming two state-of-the-art hardware approaches."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1701","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1701","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7731","fieldValue":"Berta, rpd"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7731","fieldValue":" Low-rank matrix approximation is an important tool in data mining with a wide range of applications, including recommender systems, clustering, and identifying topics in documents. When the matrix to be approximated originates from a large distributed system, such as a network of mobile phones or smart meters, a challenging problem arises due to the strongly conflicting yet essential requirements of efficiency, robustness, and privacy preservation. We argue that although collecting sensitive data in a centralized fashion may be efficient, it is not an option when considering privacy and efficiency at the same time. Thus, we do not allow any sensitive data to leave the nodes of the network. The local information at each node (personal attributes, documents, media ratings, etc.) defines one row in the matrix. This means that all computations have to be performed at the edge of the network. Known parallel methods that respect the locality constraint, such as synchronized parallel gradient search or distributed iterative methods, require synchronized rounds or have inherent issues with load balancing, and thus they are not robust to failure. Our distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm overcomes these limitations. During the execution, any sensitive information remains local, whereas the global features (e.g., the factor model of movies) converge to the correct value at all nodes. We present a theoretical derivation and a thorough experimental evaluation of our algorithm. We demonstrate that the convergence speed of our method is competitive while not relying on synchronization and being robust to extreme and realistic failure scenarios. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we present trace-based simulations, real smartphone user behavior analysis, and tests over real movie recommender system data."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7731","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7731","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7732","fieldValue":" Telecommunication (telco) operators aim to provide users with optimized services and bandwidth in a timely manner. The goal is to increase user experience while retaining profit. To do this, knowing the changing behavior patterns of users through their activity levels in advance can be a great help for operators to adjust their management strategies and reduce operational risk. To achieve this goal, the operators can make use of knowledge discovered from telcoâ\u20AC™s historical mobile broadband (MBB) records to predict mobile access activity level at an early stage. In this article, we report our research in a real-world telco setting involving more than one million telco users. Our novel contribution includes representing users as documents containing a collection of changing spatiotemporal â\u20ACœwordsâ\u20AC? that express user behavior. By extracting usersâ\u20AC™ space-time access records in MBB data, we use latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to learn user-specific compact topic features for user activity level prediction. We propose a scalable online expectation-maximization (OEM) algorithm that can scale LDA to massive MBB data, which is significantly faster than several state-of-the-art online LDA algorithms. Using these real-world MBB data, we confirm high performance in user activity level prediction. In addition, we show that the inferred topics indicate that future activity level anomalies correlate highly with early skewed bandwidth supply and demand relations. Thus, our prediction system can also guide the telco operators to balance the telecommunication network in terms of supply-demand relations, saving deployment costs and energy of cell towers in the future."}
